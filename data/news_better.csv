NEWS,Saudi Arabia,"September 21, 2017",NEWS,"Arab News (Jedda, Saudi Arabia) ","Frank Kane     NEW YORK:  dominated the opening stages of the Bloomberg Global Business Forum in New York on Wednesday, as many of the 250 business and political leaders assembled for the event criticized the Trump administration¡¯s stance on the issue.
Michael Bloomberg, the media entrepreneur and former three-time mayor of the city, announced a partnership with the World Bank and the UN to fund urban infrastructure development to take account of accelerating , especially in emerging markets where cities often struggle to get access to funding.

He said: ¡°Cities account for 70 percent of carbon emissions in the world, so they are part of the problem, but they are also big financial centers, so they are part of the solution too. New York has reduced carbon emissions by 20 percent in seven years, and it would have been faster if the city had more access to funding.

¡°In the developing world, it is even more the case that cities need access to greater funding to fight , but they do not have the credit profile to get that.¡±

On the main issue of , Bloomberg said that there had been ¡°pushback¡± from the current White House. ¡°I cannot speak for the current administration, but it¡¯s new and is realizing that these problems are complex, so it gets laughed at. But Trump has done  people a great favor because he has galvanized them.¡±

The City Climate Finance plan is a partnership between Bloomberg Philanthropies, his charitable operation, the World Bank and the UN. It hopes to have definitive plans for  investment later this year, the president Jim Kim said.

Other leaders addressed themes including globalization, immigration and inclusion, all of which have been hot topics under the Trump administration.

Former President Bill Clinton said: ¡°We are all well aware that a lot of people feel left out, left behind, alienated politically, socially and economically.¡±

Tim Cook, chief executive of Apple, said that recent moves to change immigration status for the children of illegal immigrants ? the so-called ¡°dreamers¡± ? were wrong. ¡°I am personally shocked there was even a discussion,¡± he said. ¡°This debate goes to the basis of American values. I wish everyone loved America as much as the ¡®dreamers.¡¯¡±

Bloomberg agreed: ¡°They may be here illegally but they have committed no crime. We need this new blood coming into our country.¡±

Other business leaders spoke of the need to address the problems of ¡°big data¡± and digital change in the global economy.

Jack Ma, founder and chief executive of Chinese online retailer Ali Baba, said that the digital age should be regarded as an opportunity, not a threat.

¡°People are worried about big data, but people in history were worried about steam and electricity. But all three have led to an increase in employment.¡±

Christine Lagarde, managing director of the International Monetary Fund, also defended globalization in trade and business.

Justin Trudeau, prime minister of Canada, who is due to sign a trade agreement with the EU, agreed with her that the world needed more such free trade agreements. ¡°We have to ¡¦ eliminate barriers, but also ensure jobs, gender equality and growth,¡± he said.

Other speakers pointed to the imbalances in the global financial system.

Arif Naqvi, founder and chief executive officer of Dubai-based private equity group Abraaj, said: ¡°The plumbing of the world financial system is broken. There is $9 trillion of investment value sitting in non-interest bearing assets. There are lots of other investment opportunities being missed in the fast growth markets.¡±

Larry Fink, chief executive officer of investment group Blackrock, warned against the rise of protectionism and exclusion in the world. ¡°More than 50 per cent of family assets round the world are managed by women. We need more women on our boards.¡± Copyright: Arab News ",Climate change tops the agenda at Bloomberg Business Forum
Aaron Cosbey,Saudi Arabia,"November 4, 2017",NEWS,"Arab News (Jedda, Saudi Arabia) "," may be the most difficult and urgent challenge facing mankind today. The current global plan for action ? the 2015 Paris Agreement ? calls for an economic and social transformation on the scale of the industrial revolution, but squeezed into a much more disruptive ? and tighter ? timeframe.
For that to happen, all silos of government policy will have to open up, and those outside of environment ministries will need to ask themselves what they might do to ease the transition. That message seems to be lost on trade ministries ? those in charge of negotiating international trade agreements, such as World Trade Organization (WTO) treaties, and the crop of new regional agreements under negotiation or just completed.

All these negotiations seem to be taking place in some pleasant parallel universe where  is not an issue. The problem is not a lack of potential or a dearth of possibilities. One obvious possibility is an agreement on environmental goods.

The WTO has been trying since 2001 to lower tariffs on environmental goods such as solar panels and geothermal pumps, and a smaller group of WTO members has been actively trying anew since 2014. The payoff? Faster dissemination of critically needed green technologies. But progress is stalled; when the negotiators get to the table, they forget that the environment is the goal and revert to promoting their narrow economic interests.

This is a question of political will. In the WTO and in other agreements, parties should agree on what goods are ""green"" and reduce tariffs to zero. They should also break down barriers to trade in environmental services, such as renewable energy system design and engineering for landfill methane capture.

Another possibility lies in the way trade agreements govern investment. Most modern trade agreements have mechanisms that allow investors to force states into binding arbitration when disputes arise. But the standards of justice are low (no appeals mechanism or principle of precedent, for example), the protections are poorly defined, and the awards can reach tens of billions of dollars.

The world's trade policymakers need to leave behind their obsession with a parallel world of moving goods more freely, and start getting serious about mitigating  through trade agreements.

Aaron Cosbey

The result is a crapshoot whereby investors have challenged states for lost profits over environmental regulations, such as Germany's nuclear phase out, America's denial of a major oil pipeline permit, and Italy's ban on offshore oil operations. There are at least two ways trade agreements could help assure parties that they will not have to pay investors for new climate laws.

The text could weaken the legal basis for compensation by declaring the parties' intention to aggressively address , and warning that investors should not expect business as usual. In the same vein, countries should strive to define undesirable or ""climate-damaging"" investments, and deny them access to potentially powerful arbitration.

The past decade has seen an explosion of cases where countries impose charges on imports of green goods, such as solar panels, to protect domestic producers from ""unfair"" foreign competition.

Trade agreements could commit parties to forgo using their national regimes to investigate foreign dumping and subsidies for green goods, referring those investigations instead to the WTO ? a more balanced, less politicized forum. This would mean fewer obstacles to flows of critically needed green technologies.

Trade negotiators could also agree to harmonize product efficiency standards. A 2015 study commissioned by the European Commission predicted that harmonizing standards at the highest current levels for the likes of televisions, industrial pumps and lighting would shave 11 percent off global energy consumption by 2030, benefiting the climate and saving consumers hundreds of billions of dollars.

The biggest win-win might be agreement to phase out fossil fuel subsidies, estimated at more than $500 billion a year globally. This is not exactly foreign territory for trade agreements, which already discipline trade-distorting subsidies.

The G-20 in 2009 agreed to a limited phase-out, as did the UN's universally agreed Sustainable Development Goals in 2015, but results to date have been meager. This despite the high stakes; a full phase-out would reduce global greenhouse gas emissions by a whopping 6-8 percent.

It would be easier to understand the trade-climate disconnect if the available options ran counter to the goals of the trading system. But they do not; they are about moving more goods and services across borders, reducing distorting subsidies, removing barriers to imports and firming up the rule of law.

If we are serious about avoiding the disasters of , trade policymakers are going to have to leave their parallel universe and get creative about ways the trade regime can meaningfully contribute.

Bjorn Lomborg,Saudi Arabia,"December 22, 2017",NEWS,"Arab News (Jedda, Saudi Arabia) ","Two years after the Paris climate agreement was signed, the French capital this month again attracted the world's great and good, who gathered for President Emmanuel Macron's One Planet summit. In turns blasting US President Donald Trump for withdrawing from the Paris accord and telling each other that it remains on track, politicians formed a self-congratulatory huddle with celebrity campaigners and business leaders.
We should treat such smug bonhomie with caution. Goodwill isn't enough to stop  and history is littered with well-meaning policies that turned out be unhelpful, or even worse than the problems they were meant to address.

One particularly harrowing example was Mao Zedong's attempt to improve crop yields and health by eradicating sparrows. The population of locusts ballooned, contributing to a famine that claimed around 30 million lives.

But no government is immune. US President Bill Clinton admits that his landmark ""three strikes"" crime law in 1994 backfired by jailing so many people ""there wasn't enough money left to educate them, train them for new jobs, and increase (their) chances when they came out."" In the following decade, it seemed prudent for the United States to keep its worst Iraqi prisoners in one camp ? but this is now blamed for helping future Daesh leaders learn how to plot.

Often, policy flaws become apparent only in retrospect. To identify them in real time, we need to be able to undertake a calm analysis of costs and impacts. No topic requires this more than . Consider this month's summit in Paris, where attention focused either on the Trump administration's absence, or on other world leaders' defiance of him. Nowhere have we heard about the Paris agreement's actual costs and effects.

Economic science helps us establish the scale of the problem. The Intergovernmental Panel on  (IPCC), the UN's climate body, estimates that, in about 60 years, global warming will cost the planet between 0.2 percent and 2 percent of GDP. That's a problem, but it's not the end of the world.

Right now, the net cost of global warming is actually close to zero. This seems untrue because we hear an onslaught of terrible climate-related news. But we don't get the full picture.

A drought in Syria understandably makes news, but global warming overall means more precipitation. Globally, an overview by the journal ""Nature"" finds that droughts have been decreasing since 1982. Thus, while global warming might have contributed to some droughts, overall it has reduced them; but an absence of droughts hardly generates headlines.

Similarly, we hear concern that tropical forests are being stripped. But, while this deserves attention, the bigger story is that, because more carbon dioxide fertilizes vegetation,  has actually increased the world's green matter (plants of all sorts) since 1982 by the equivalent of an entire continent.

The policies lauded in Paris are essentially high-cost, low-effect gestures ? even fully achieving the accord's emissions targets throughout this century would prevent just 0.053C of global warming by 2100.

Bjorn Lomborg

The best estimates thus show that global warming right now has about a zero net cost (the most pessimistic study finds a cost of 0.3 percent of GDP, the most optimistic a net benefit of 2.3 percent). That will rise to 2 percent in 50 years, and to 3 to 4 percent early in the 22nd century if we don't act.

But the climate policies lauded in Paris are essentially high-cost, low-effect gestures. The EU will devote 20 percent of its budget this year to climate-related action. Taking into account the total cost to the economy, the EU's bill will likely be around ¢æ209 billion ($240 billion).

The benefits will be vanishingly small. Accounting for the EU's commitments to reduce carbon dioxide emissions under the Paris accord up to 2030, my peer-reviewed analysis shows that, in the most optimistic scenario, emissions targets ? fully achieved and adhered to throughout this century ? would prevent just 0.053C of global warming by 2100.

That small impact is not a sufficient reason to dump the EU's emissions reduction policy. But it should force us to consider whether the cure is costlier than the disease, and ask what other approaches might be better.

Another peer-reviewed study shows that each dollar spent on EU climate policies will generate a total long-term climate benefit of just three cents. And, despite the cheer coming from France, the Paris accord is just as off-balance: At a $1-2 trillion annual cost, the UN itself estimates that it is on track to achieve 1 percent of what would be needed to keep temperature rises under 2C.

We need smarter, cheaper options. My think tank, the Copenhagen Consensus, asked 27 of the world's top climate economists to explore all the feasible policy responses, and we concluded that the best long-term investment is in green energy research and development. For every dollar spent, $11 of climate damage would be avoided. That makes much more sense than spending a fortune on carbon dioxide cuts that do next to nothing.

Countries should ease up on their current, inefficient climate policies and instead increase spending on green R&D. Only innovation can shift the price of future green energy below fossil fuels, thereby impelling everyone to switch. We also need cheap, effective adaptation to avoid the worst climate damage. The main source of vulnerability to future climate damage is poverty: The poor will be hit the hardest, as they are by every other global challenge. So, lifting people out of poverty will help more than anything else.

Despite lofty rhetoric from Paris, all the best intentions on the planet will count for little if it turns out that our climate ""solution"" was just another policy that cost the planet far more than it gained.

Cornelia Meyer,Saudi Arabia,"December 15, 2017",NEWS,"Arab News (Jedda, Saudi Arabia) ","On Tuesday, French President Emmanuel Macron convened the ""One Planet"" summit to mark the two-year anniversary of the Paris Agreement on . The accord delineates measures to keep global warming well below 2C until the end of the century. Macron's co-hosts were United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres and World Bank President Jim Yong Kim. The great and the good were invited, but Donald Trump was a notable omission. On June 1 of this year, he had declared the US' withdrawal from the Paris accord. He did so uttering the memorable words that he had been ""elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris.""
This is as good a time as any to review what happened on the  front this year: The planet was raging from wildfires in California and hurricanes in the Caribbean to floods on the Indian subcontinent and droughts in Africa. Quite apart from the human and environmental costs, markets will notice what happened, particularly when they are faced with the shrinking profitability of insurers and reinsurers. These companies have to face ever-increasing payouts due to environmental catastrophes.

Trump is the odd man out, because all of the world's other countries have now signed up. Trump also asked Scott Pruitt, a  skeptic, to head the Environmental Protection Agency, and he swiftly proceeded to cancel many useful Bush and Obama era measures and guidelines. Trump's budget furthermore favors carbon-based fuel sources and nuclear energy and penalizes renewables. The withdrawal of ""tax equity"" in the form of the obscure Base Erosion Anti-Abuse Tax will take as much as $50 billion out of financing wind turbines. It may cost the industry up to 60,000 jobs in the US. Worse, it brings uncertainty to foreign banks. The likes of BNP Paribas, Deutsche Bank and Credit Suisse had availed of the tax breaks for renewable energy and invested generously. One stroke of a brush rendered that business model invalid. These institutions will be careful in trusting US policies going forward, which will have ramifications far beyond the energy sector. The policies are also bound to impact on research and development. Here the US should be careful: China has advanced rapidly and is now one of the key technology hubs for renewable energy. When it comes to the environment and renewable energy, the actions of Trump and Pruitt may well be counter-productive to the overall goal of ""making America great again.""

The Paris Agreement is not dead ? most countries and companies, even oil and mining giants, see the importance of accounting for greenhouse gas emissions.

Cornelia Meyer

What the US does matters on the international stage. In November, the UN Framework Convention on  held its annual conference (COP23) in Bonn. The hosts were Fiji but the island was too small to accommodate the thousands of participants and observers, which is why Germany provided the infrastructure. It was powerful and added a sense of urgency having one of the countries most affected by rising sea levels hosting the meeting. Unusually, a strong and vocal anti-US government delegation was in attendance (anti-government representation is generally a phenomenon of smaller war-torn countries, not of the leader of the free world). It was headed by former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg and California Governor Jerry Brown.

The Paris accord was only agreed because it benefited from strong US leadership. Now that has dissipated, emerging economies worry about sufficient endowment of the $100 billion-a-year fund designed to compensate them for the costs of taking measures alleviating . Turkey has already indicated it might leave the agreement if the promised funds were not available by 2020. Russia has also become more skeptical. The absence of the US also meant that COP23 and the One Planet summit featured far less prominently in the international news cycle than they should have. It is now up to the UN, the World Bank, and EU leaders, Canada, Mexico and China to keep the momentum going.

This brings us back to Paris. The World Bank has announced it would no longer finance oil and gas developments, save in the very poorest countries. Two hundred institutional investors with $26 trillion under management have so far signed up to the disclosure requirements of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). The TCFD is a G-20 initiative headed by Bank of England Governor Mark Carney and Bloomberg that encourages disclosure of the greenhouse gas emissions of investments. Banks, insurers and pension funds all see the validity in the TCFC guidelines. The Paris Agreement is not dead and most countries and companies, even oil giants and miners like Shell, BHP Billiton, Glencore and BP, see the importance of accounting for greenhouse gas emissions. Many GCC governments have also made a big push toward renewable energy and carbon-neutral modes of transportation. The  debate will be with us for the foreseeable future. What happens to mother earth is important to all of mankind ? it would be a shame if the US remained the odd country out.

Kerry Boyd Anderson,Saudi Arabia,"November 14, 2017",NEWS,"Arab News (Jedda, Saudi Arabia) ","A report released earlier this month by the Environmental Justice Foundation adds to a growing body of research that suggests a historically severe drought in Syria was an important ? though certainly not the sole ? factor contributing to the conflict there, and that drought poses an increasing risk to conflict worldwide.
Throughout human history, there has been a clear link between competition over scarce water resources and conflict. In the 20th century, it became clear that drought can exacerbate conflict, and that in turn conflict creates conditions that can turn drought into famine.

In the 21st century, growing research demonstrates the direct contributions that drought can make to instability and conflict. Furthermore, it is becoming clearer that  due to greenhouse gas emissions is increasing the prevalence and severity of drought, and thus contributing to conflict.

To be clear, few researchers have argued that drought alone causes conflict; rather, the evidence suggests that drought is one of multiple factors that increase the risk of political instability, conflict and war ? in other words, drought is a ""threat multiplier.""

Furthermore, few researchers argue that  alone causes drought; rather, the evidence suggests that  is increasing the frequency, duration and degree of drought. As  continues, the degree to which severe weather contributes to conflict is likely to increase unless people and leaders recognize the risk and try to mitigate it.

While drought can increase risks of conflict between countries, most of the research to date focuses on drought's contribution to sub-state conflict. Various studies have identified drought as a contributing factor to conflicts in Syria, Yemen, Somalia, South Sudan, Mali, Nigeria and other places. In some cases, drought contributes to the factors that start a conflict. In some cases, drought plays a role in lengthening or expanding a conflict, and exacerbating the suffering of civilians caught up in war.

Studies by multiple academics, think tanks and journalists have considered the role that  and drought played in the run-up to the Syrian civil war. From 2007-2010, Syria experienced the area's worst drought ""in the instrumental record,"" according to an article published in the March 2015 edition of the US journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS). The authors wrote that  due to greenhouse gas emissions ""increased the probability of severe and persistent droughts in this region, and made the occurrence of a 3-year drought as severe as that of 2007&minus;2010 2 to 3 times more likely than by natural variability alone.""

Even more shocking, a NASA study published in 2016 found that ""the recent drought that began in 1998 in the eastern Mediterranean Levant region, which comprises Cyprus, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Palestine, Syria, and Turkey, is likely the worst drought of the past nine centuries.""

Considered a major factor in the spread of extremism in countries like Syria, Nigeria and Mali, it's high time the international community found ways to mitigate drought's social and political effects.

Kerry Boyd Anderson

The drought caused largescale migration from rural areas to Syria's cities. An Atlantic Council article published in September said more than 1.5 million people in Syria ""moved from rural or urban areas"" during the drought, and contributed to a significant drop in Syria's gross domestic product (GDP) per capita. Many cities were already under strain from a previous influx of Iraqi refugees and government mismanagement.

The resulting increase in poverty and social tensions, and the apparent failure of the government to address the problem, likely contributed to the 2011 protests that preceded the civil war. It is important to again note that drought was not the only or even primary cause of the Syrian conflict, but rather a factor that increased the risk of instability.

In some cases, drought plays a less direct role in raising the risks of instability. A 2013 study by the Center for American Progress, the Stimson Center and the Center for Climate and Security examined the ways in which weather events in other parts of the world, including drought in China, contributed to very high global wheat prices in 2010 and 2011, creating a significant burden for Egypt, the world's biggest wheat importer. High food prices were likely one of several factors that contributed to the 2011 protests in Egypt.

In places where water scarcity combines with conflict, water is sometimes weaponized by states or groups. Daesh was particularly adept at weaponizing water; a study in June by the Center for Climate and Security found that Daesh ""was responsible for 21 of the 44 (water) weaponization incidents we catalogued from 2012-2015."" Multiple media reports also attest to its use of water in war.

The contribution that drought can make to conflict has importance far beyond the immediate locales affected by conflict. Drought has indirect but important links to migration from the eastern Mediterranean and North Africa to Europe, with significant political and humanitarian consequences. Drought has been a contributing factor in the spread of extremism in countries such as Syria, Nigeria and Mali, which can also have consequences far beyond them.

Understanding the role that  plays in making drought more prevalent and extreme, and understanding how drought contributes to conflict, is important for the international community, as is considering ways to mitigate drought's social and political effects.

International Monetary Fund Managing Director Christine Lagarde looks at the CEO of Saudi Aramco, Amin Nasser, as he speaks during the Future Investment Initiative conference in Riyadh. (AFP)

LONDON: The planet faces a ""dark"" future in 50 years if leaders fail to address  and growing global inequality, Christine Lagarde, head of the International Monetary Fund, said during a panel discussion at the Future Investment Initiative (FII) conference in Riyadh yesterday.

On , she said the world would be ""toasted, roasted and grilled, so decisions are needed at this point in time.""

She recognized advances in developing green energy sources, which would mean oil becoming a secondary commodity over the next half century, something KSA had taken on board.

On inequality, she flagged up imbalances between men and women ? applauding, however, recent positive developments in the Kingdom. She also highlighted the lack of equality between countries, with a crossover between inequality and climate as nations in the firing line from  tend to be low-income economies.

Failure to address these two pressing issues could usher in a ""dark"" and ""dystopian"" world in 50 years, and one that ""I don't want to depict as it is too sad,"" said Lagarde.

The FII conference is being hosted by Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, which has been charged with funding development projects in the Kingdom to

help offset over-dependency on

oil revenue.

The panel discussion was titled ""The big shift: what new frameworks are needed to understand the future?""

Lagarde said: ""If we address inequality and  things will look a lot better, but it will look different. (We might not have) the nation state anymore, it might be large mega-cities that will be the driving actors, it might be private sector actors. The new international order will require greater cooperation, monetary policy that might have more universal aspects to it, crypto currencies (but)I don't want to bet on that.""

On the same discussion panel, Amin Nasser, president and CEO of Saudi Aramco, warned that global energy security could be jeopardized in five to seven years' time if $1 trillion of investments in the hydrocarbon industry was deferred or canceled, as forecast by some experts.

Nasser reminded the audience that the slump in the oil price in 2014-16 to a low of $40 per barrel from a peak of about $100 per barrel came about only because of an additional 2 million barrels of supply came onto the market, highlighting how supply and demand could easily be brought out of kilter. Additional investment was needed, he said, to meet future demand growth.

Nasser said Aramco had noted the growth in electric vehicles (EVs), but they still represented less that 1 percent of the global car market and, although there would be additional growth, even the most bullish forecast was for only 530,000 EVs by 2040, compared to about 1.5 billion vehicles relying on conventional engines, he told the conference.

He added: ""We are not worried about electric vehicles and renewables; we are looking to invest in green energy as it is a good sector ? not only in the Kingdom, but also globally.""

NEWS,Saudi Arabia,"January 22, 2017",NEWS,"Arab News (Jedda, Saudi Arabia) ","Former Maldives President Mohammed Nasheed
PARK CITY, United States: He faces jail in the Maldives but former President Mohammed Nasheed says he wants to contest elections and guide the island nation away from environmental catastrophe.

Nasheed became the first democratically elected president of the Maldives in 2008, but lives in exile in London after he was jailed on terrorism charges that he says were politically motivated.

""I do not think I can return home without risks. I don't think there will ever be a time for that,"" the 49-year-old said during a visit to the Sundance Film Festival in Utah.

""I guess I will have to take the risks and do it, if I were to do it.""

In the past, he has accused Maumoon Abdul Gayoom, who ruled the Maldives for 30 years and is still regarded as the power behind the throne, of being behind his downfall.

But in September he indicated he wanted to bury the hatchet with Gayoom, amid reports of a rift between the former strongman leader and his half-brother, current President Abdulla Yameen.

""We are still working on it. What we would really like to see is a free and fair election ? not necessarily changing the government now,"" he said.

""I do not think we will have a free and fair election as things stand now. So we will have to have the whole opposition together and come out with a single candidate.""

Once a honeymoon paradise before its tourism industry was shaken by political unrest, the Indian Ocean island chain could be underwater by 2100, according to the UN.

""It is already happening in the Maldives, it is not something that is going to happen. We are already going through it,"" said Nasheed, adding that 16 of the 196 inhabitable islands already needed to be evacuated.

Nasheed is pushing for the Maldives to use its own resources, rather than international aid, to bolster its defenses against rising seas and coastal erosion. ""To do that, we must have investor confidence, for us to bring the money into the country. It is my view that we have enough resources,"" he said.

Investment has stopped because of corruption, he says, citing what he describes as the unlawful termination of construction contracts by Yameen's government.

In October last year, the country was ordered by an arbitration panel in Singapore to pay Indian construction firm GMR $270 million after canceling a contract to build the airport near Male.

Nasheed says the government reneged on the deal to allow another company paying big backhanders to step in.

The politician is at Sundance to take part in a  discussion panel on Sunday with former US Vice President Al Gore, now a celebrated environmental champion.

The Maldivian rails against the argument forwarded by developing economies such as India that they are entitled to as many years of polluting the environment as the West was allowed.

""This is like saying the West has brought us to the brink and therefore now the developing countries must have the opportunity to push us off the cliff,"" he said.

A crackdown on political dissent in the nation of 340,000 has dented its popular image as an upmarket holiday paradise in recent years.

Almost all key opposition leaders and a number of ruling party dissidents have either been jailed or gone into exile since Yameen took office after winning a controversial run-off election against Nasheed in 2013.

Nasheed was jailed for 13 years in 2015 but granted prison leave last year for medical treatment in London, where he secured political asylum. A UN panel has ruled that his imprisonment was illegal and ordered the regime to pay him compensation.

Nasheed spoke as Donald Trump was being sworn in as the 45th US president after years of  denial.

Trump's nomination for Environmental Protection Agency chief is Scott Pruitt, a fossil fuels advocate who was still voicing skepticism over the concept of man-made  as recently as his Senate nomination hearing on Wednesday.

""I completely respect the decision of the American people. They voted their own president in and there's nothing wrong with that at all,"" Nasheed said.

""I do not think  issues, or the progress made, can be reversed by any single person.""

It is put to Nasheed that Trump has wondered aloud about reneging on carbon-reduction commitments made at the global climate talks in Paris last year, claiming  is low on the list of America's priorities.

""Many politicians when they come to positions think that,"" Nasheed said.

""But when you start running a government you find out the truth, and you can't run away from it.""

News channels are vying for ever-shrinking TV audiences with powerful visuals and aggressive story lines. We can follow breaking stories as they happen on our smartphones but is this intense focus on the moment making us lose our sense of perspective?

Climate-focused scientists agree that global warming and  are issues that should be addressed at the topmost levels of government and in the public forum. Yet most of us believe that the consequences of climate changes are too far off to bear any real impact. Moreover, the countries which govern the planet have been conspicuously ineffective in addressing this looming environmental crisis.

What is the problem? Why is the decision making process so slow? Why is there such an acute lack of environmental awareness? Is it that people have become too self-centered and narcissistic to care about the common good of our planet?

Our planet has entered a new geological era which environmentalist Bill McKibben has coined as the Anthropocene era. This era began with the industrial revolution and it is characterized by a blatant disregard for nature in the name of private interests. The Anthropocene era refers to Earth¡¯s most recent geologic time period, an era during which man has become the major factor causing planetary change. Chris Rapley, a scientist at University College London explains that since the planet is our life support, ¡°we are essentially the crew of a largish spaceship and interference with its functioning at this level and on this scale is highly significant. The shift into the Anthropocene tells us that we are playing with fire, a potentially reckless mode of behavior which we are likely to come to regret unless we get a grip on the situation.¡±

Nation states have failed to adequately address the environmental crisis which is threatening the sustainability of Earth. The author convincingly argues that traditional politics must gave way to ¡°a politics of participation that devolves power back to people closer to where they actually live ? back to cities. Shift the focus down to municipalities and over to civil society¡¦ Hope for the future lies with the politics of the city.¡±

Mayors are not only pragmatic but they also have the capacity to implement a program of sustainable policies for a world that is getting warmer.

¡°On a hot planet, cities are cool,¡± claims Barber and a host of mayors, former mayors and key political figures share his thoughts. Michael Bloomberg, New York¡¯s former mayor, has stated that ¡°cities have played a more important role in shaping the world than empires¡± and also that ¡°cities can be the engine of social equity and economic opportunity. They can help us reduce our carbon footprint and protect the global environment.¡±

The world is connected as it never was before. However, globalization has affected sovereign nations. They have become less effective and even dysfunctional when it comes to global governance. People not only aspire to live in sustainable cities but they are also expected to play an increasing role in safeguarding the sustainability of our planet.

Concerned citizens in Beirut have created a powerful urban political movement known as ¡°Beirut Madinati,¡± which translates to mean Beirut, my city. A group of motivated residents decided to take on Lebanon¡¯s old guard for the control of Beirut¡¯s municipal council. They launched Beirut Madinati, a Western-style political party financed by crowd-funding. Although they did not win local elections, it has sent a powerful message which shows that cities empowered by citizens can act and achieve their goals faster than states.

¡°When national governments fail to act on crucial issues like , cities have to do so,¡± Bill de Blasio, the current mayor of New York, said.

Sadiq Khan, London¡¯s mayor, demonstrated strong resolve following Britain¡¯s vote to exit the EU. He insisted on sticking to the country¡¯s green commitments, saying: ¡°Leaving the EU should not be the first step of us going back to being known as the dirty man of Europe.¡±

Prime examples

Oslo, the capital of Norway, is at the forefront of sustainable urban development. Almost all of Norway¡¯s energy is currently provided by hydroelectric power. Almost all of its oil and gas revenues feed into Norway¡¯s sovereign fund.

Oslo is also aiming to be a city of electric vehicles. Visitors coming to Oslo might be surprised to find a fleet of electric taxis ready to ferry them around the city. There are plenty of charging stations all over the city too.

It is not only big cities that deal with  effectively. The US town of Bridgeport, with a population of less than 150,000, set up a program of environmental policies under the leadership of former mayor, Bill Finch.

Bridgeport succeeded in removing 600 tons of contaminated soils from an industrial site, invested a million dollars to provide low-income communities with access to waterfront parks and contracted businesses to create vegetated rain gardens to control storm runoff. These measures show that when you combine imagination, resilience and strong resolve, a city can create an environmentally-friendly atmosphere

With a rising global population and states failing to secure sustainability, the world has reached a turning point. Barber argues that cities have a new role to play. They can and they must take the lead in fighting . Empowered by concerned citizens, cities have the energy and the resolve to achieve sustainability. Cities have a crucial role to play in global governance and they are the key to our survival.

NEWS,Saudi Arabia,"January 19, 2017",NEWS,"Arab News (Jedda, Saudi Arabia) ",", United States: Last year, the Earth sweltered under the hottest temperatures in modern times for the third year in a row, US scientists said Wednesday, raising new concerns about the quickening pace of .
Temperatures spiked to new national highs in parts of India, Kuwait and Iran, while sea ice melted faster than ever in the fragile Arctic, said the report by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

Taking a global average of the land and sea surface temperatures for the entire year, NOAA found the data for ""2016 was the highest since record keeping began in 1880,"" said the announcement.

The global average temperature last year was 1.69 Fahrenheit (0.94 Celsius) above the 20th century average, and 0.07 degrees F (0.04 C) warmer than in 2015, the last record-setting year, according to NOAA.

This was ""not a huge margin to set a new record but it is larger than the typical margin,"" Deke Arndt, chief of NOAA global climate monitoring, said on a conference call with reporters.

A separate analysis by the US space agency NASA also found that 2016 was the hottest on record.

The World Meteorological Organization in Geneva confirmed the US findings, and noted that atmospheric concentrations of both carbon dioxide and methane reached new highs.



Greenhouse gasses

The main reason for the rise is the burning of fossil fuels like oil and gas, which send carbon dioxide, methane and other pollutants known as greenhouse gasses into the atmosphere and warm the planet.

The mounting toll of industrialization on the Earth's natural balance is increasingly apparent in the record books of recent decades.

""Since the start of the 21st century, the annual global temperature record has been broken five times (2005, 2010, 2014, 2015 and 2016),"" said NOAA.

Another factor has been the Pacific Ocean warming trend of El Nino, which experts say exacerbates the planet's already rising warmth.

El Nino comes and goes. The latest episode became particularly strong in 2015, and subsided about halfway through 2016.

But El Nino was responsible for just a small fraction of last year's warmth, according to Peter Stott, acting director of Britain's Met Office Hadley Center.

""The main contributor to warming over the last 150 years is human influence on climate from increasing greenhouse gases in the atmosphere,"" he said.

This year is likely be cooler, but probably not by much, said Gavin Schmidt, director of NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York.

""Because the long-term trends are so clear, it is still going to be a top-five year in our analysis. I'm pretty confident about that."" he told reporters.



Kuwait's all-time high

Last year, all of North America was the warmest since records began in 1910, breaking that region's last record set in 1998.

Europe and Asia each saw their third hottest years on record, while Australia marked its fourth warmest year since records began more than a century ago.

Unusual spikes in temperature were seen in Phalodi, India, which reached 124 F (51 C) on May 19 ? marking India's hottest temperature ever.

Dehloran, Iran hit 127 F (53 C) on July 22, a new national record.

Meanwhile, Mitribah, Kuwait hit an all-time high of 129 F (54 C) on July 21, which may be the highest temperature ever recorded in all of Asia, NOAA said.

Planet-wide, the heat led to more melting at the poles. In the Arctic, average annual sea ice extent was approximately 3.92 million square miles (10.2 million square kilometers), the smallest annual average in the record, NOAA said.

Antarctic annual sea ice extent was the second smallest on record.



Decarbonization

Unusually hot years wreak havoc on the planet by increasing rainfall in some parts of the world while leading to drought in others, damaging crops.

Fish and birds must migrate farther than ever to find suitable temperatures and habitats.

Diseases can spread faster in the warming waters, sickening marine life and killing corals.

Glaciers and polar ice caps melt, accelerating sea level rise that will eventually swallow many of the globe's coastal communities, home to some one billion people.

Experts say the only solution is to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels, in favor of Earth-friendly renewable energy such as wind and solar.

"" is one of the great challenges of the twenty first century and shows no signs of slowing down,"" said Mark Maslin, professor of climatology at University College London.

""The decarbonization of the global economy is the ultimate goal to prevent the worst effects of .""

Edmund S. Phelps,Saudi Arabia,"December 25, 2017",NEWS,"Arab News (Jedda, Saudi Arabia) ","Every country has national problems, such as a dangerous loss of inclusion or a costly loss of growth. We learn that a solution does not happen without society's understanding of the problem and a wide desire for action.
But, with , all countries have a shared problem. And, although experts have gained understanding and reached a consensus on the objectives to be sought, these goals require wider support from society than exists so far.

As everyone knows, most of the  started with the burning of fossil fuels brought on by the industrialization that began in the late 18th century, and has been producing rising levels of carbon dioxide ever since.

A major point is that the climate has already deteriorated to such an extent that it has become costly to society and even dangerous to life: The violence of hurricanes has risen following the rise of water temperature in the Caribbean, air quality is deteriorating noticeably around the world, and rising sea levels are threatening many low-lying cities.



Many regulations may be needed to protect the planet, but we must be careful not to strangle the sources of what makes life worth living.

Edmund S. Phelps



In his recent book, ""Endangered Economies,"" economist Geoffrey Heal surveys the array of measures, public and private, taken to block further . A point introduced by Heal is that the damage ? in many cases, the devastation ? done to our natural world has serious consequences not only for the air and water we depend on for our existence, but also for businesses, which have relied on free natural benefits such as pollination, the water cycle, marine and forest ecosystems, and more. Thus, preserving ""natural capital"" would raise the rate of return on capital in the business sector. Businesses would react by investing more, thus boosting productivity in the economy. And, with each such boost, we could afford a greater effort that would preserve still more of the world's natural capital.

The world, then, must give up aspiring to economic growth so rapid that it is running down the world's natural capital. We want economic growth that is ""green"" ? without damaging or destroying the environment. At the same time, we want improvement of the environment without stopping innovation and economic growth.

In a series of powerful presentations and interviews, the Columbia University economist and mathematician Graciela Chichilnisky contends that mankind's survival requires that we remove the carbon dioxide already accumulated in the atmosphere and ensure that it stays out of the atmosphere. To cover the cost, Chichilnisky proposes a marketplace in which the captured carbon is sold for commercial use.

Another possible solution is ""regenerative agriculture,"" which the biologist Allan Savory recently introduced in Patagonia. If made profitable, these innovations could create an incentive for private actors to undertake carbon capture far beyond what a national government could afford to conduct. However, success will depend on whether ""carbon farming"" stays profitable even in a context of increasing supply, and thus falling prices.

We will also have to come to grips with fundamental challenges such as continuing population growth, industrialization and weak governance. And we will have to strike a balance between fighting  and ensuring that most people still have lives that are worth living.

One might look at the growing body of research into  and conclude that we can rest easy: The experts have already worked out what needs to be done. But the experts themselves are not so naive. They know that businesses will not police themselves, and they recognize that much will depend on whether the profit motive can be harnessed for social good. The problem is that too many people assume that businesses, households and policymakers will simply do what the experts recommend. That all companies ? out of social pressure or threats from the state ? will pay for the damage they cause; and that all governments will eventually institute carbon taxes or cap-and-trade arrangements to reduce and eventually eliminate emissions.

Another problem is that much environmental damage is not straightforward to control. Even if large public companies see fit to offset their pollution by, say, re-planting rainforests in Central America, the earth has come to have a human population that is huge and still rising, and this presents challenges. As the economist Dennis J. Snower showed some years ago, discrete individual activities ? such as fishing, cooking on wood-fired stoves or simply letting the water run ? can contribute significantly to pollution and environmental degradation, but go largely unseen by governments, communities, and individuals. That being the case, any program to protect the environment must be based on moral persuasion: To call on all individuals, not just corporations, to summon whatever sense of altruism they have and voluntarily curb their own polluting.

Yet another problem is that many countries are still undergoing industrialization. So, even if every country on the planet could reduce its per capita contribution to pollution, the ongoing rise in the proportion of the world's population working in countries that are now in the stage of industrializing will pull up the global average. Clearly, this demographic phenomenon will make for tough going as we pursue Heal's proposed measures to limit carbon dioxide emissions.

We will also have to confront the fact that not all governments are able to stand up to vested interests. Powerful companies can get away with violating environmental restrictions issued by the government, especially if they are a major source of income and jobs.

More difficulties arise if most people are still poor but determined to become rich ? as rich as the richest countries in the West. In such a country, the government might not be ready to cut deep into carbon emissions or other pollution lest it miss its growth target. It has been estimated that about 20 percent of the world's population accounts for 80 percent of the world's consumption of natural resources. Because the right to survival trumps any one country's right to ruin the environment in pursuit of growth, the countries leading the fight against  will have to be tough with those that think the costs of reducing emissions are too high.

Lastly, renewable energies could pose new challenges for wages and employment in the future. According to the International Renewable Energy Agency, the US wind and solar industries have been creating jobs ? employing 777,000 people in 2016 ? while the coal industry has continued to shed them. But this is not a useful observation, given that employees flocking to new industries generally come from other industries, not from some vast pool of unemployed but well-suited workers. It would be absurd to think that total employment is raised by every newly arriving industry.

Economic theory implies that a new industry will expand overall employment only if its method of production is more labor-intensive than the cross-industry average. However, I have yet to see data for the renewables sector that addresses this issue, and I would not be surprised if the industry became highly capital-intensive over time.

I have long emphasized not just the material rewards of work ? mainly wage rates (from the bottom up) and labor force participation rates ? but also the non-material side of work (the various satisfactions that people derive from the experience of work). Now that the imagination and ingenuity of our experts and engineers have helped us turn the corner, it will be important that we get back to business: To conceive of new products and methods of production, test them in the market, and strive for the new.

As Abraham Lincoln once said: ""Young America¡¦ has a great passion ? a perfect rage ? for the 'new'."" It is time for us all to be young like that again. As the project to reclaim our environment plays out and as the other international challenges are being met and resolved, we should revive an older concept of work based on exercising one's initiative and using one's creativity. The good life must again be understood as a personal voyage into the unknown, through which one might ""act on the world"" and ""make your garden grow"" in order to be ""somebody.""

The worry ? my worry, at any rate ? is that our national economies, many of them already highly regulated in the name of stability, will become much more regulated in the name of a green economy. Yes, many regulations may be needed, but we must be careful in our efforts to save the planet that we do not strangle the sources of what makes life worth living.

Andrew Hammond,Saudi Arabia,"December 17, 2017",NEWS,"Arab News (Jedda, Saudi Arabia) ","President Emmanuel Macron declared at the One Planet climate summit in France last week that ""we're losing"" the battle against global warming. Nevertheless, at a time when there is increasing concern about the effectiveness of the UN's Paris treaty agreed two years ago, he rightly re-energized support for it and predicted that the US would reverse its decision to leave the pact, potentially even before the end of Donald Trump's presidency.
The landmark Paris deal came after many years of painstaking negotiations and was agreed by more than 190 countries, providing a welcome shot in the arm for attempts to tackle global warming. Crucially, a new post-Kyoto framework was also put in place. The more ambitious than expected deal agreed to see greenhouse gas emissions peak ""as soon as possible,"" and achieve a balance between sources and sinks of greenhouse gases in the second half of this century, with progress reviewed every five years.

The agreement retains significant international support, as shown by the dozens of world political leaders and a host of other key players, including Bill Gates, Arnold Schwarzenegger and Michael Bloomberg, at the One Planet event.

In the two years since it was agreed, detractors of the Paris deal ? from different parts of the political spectrum ? have already sought to diminish its significance. However, the agreement deserves to be defended robustly for, as then-US President Barack Obama asserted in 2015, it ""represents the best chance we have to save the one planet that we have got.""

Those who argue that Paris is not ambitious enough need to remember that the long-running UN-brokered talks nearly collapsed several times over the years, and that this was one of the most complex set of international negotiations ever; the 1997 Kyoto Protocol involved a deal for the EU states and 37 developed countries, but Paris also involved developing countries and thus a much wider range of difficult issues. Indeed, part of the deal's importance is that it represents the first genuinely global treaty to tackle .

While the agreement is far from perfect, it has nonetheless kept the process alive, the potential importance of which cannot be overestimated. Moreover, the once-every-five-years review framework means countries could, in the future, toughen their response to , especially if the political and public will to tackle the problem increases with time ? as will hopefully be the case.

So, rather than viewing the Paris agreement as the end of the process, it must be seen as a very important stepping stone on a longer journey that countries must now make. This is only possible because the talks did not collapse and we now have a post-Kyoto framework in place.

Other critics of the deal, including skeptics of  such as Trump, have also lambasted the agreement, albeit for different reasons. Despite the now-overwhelming scientific evidence about the risks of global warming, Trump and many others argue that it is at worst a grand hoax, and at best an unwelcome distraction from other key issues.

The consequence of a failure to act now, as global warming skeptics seem to advocate, would be the growing likelihood of devastating environmental damage to the planet.

Andrew Hammond

While there is always uncertainty with science, these critics are misguided. Even if, remarkably, it turns out that the vast majority of scientists in the world are wrong about global warming, what the Paris deal will help achieve is moving more swiftly to remove our dependence on fossil fuels, making the world a cleaner, less polluted and more sustainable place. Moreover, many countries will also develop a broader range of energies, especially renewables, which can enhance energy sovereignty at a time of potentially growing geopolitical turbulence.

Alternatively, the consequences of a failure to act now, as climate skeptics seem to advocate, would be the growing likelihood of devastating environmental damage to the planet. As the overwhelming evidence suggests, this is folly on a global scale.

So, despite what critics assert, the Paris deal was a positive step forward that topped off a very significant year in 2015, which some have called a once?in-a-generation opportunity to build a new international framework to address the challenges of global warming and sustainable development more broadly. Paris followed not only a UN summit in New York, which agreed the new 2030 development goals, but also a Financing for Development conference in Addis Ababa, and the agreement of a new Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction in Sendai, Japan. Collectively, these agreements could yet provide a foundation stone for global sustainable development for billions across the world.

Regarding Paris specifically, what is now important is that the political window of opportunity provided by the treaty is now followed up, and this was part of Macron's ambition this week. Two years on from its agreement, implementation will be most effective through national laws and regulations as the ""commitments"" put forward in Paris will be more credible ? and durable beyond the next set of national elections ? if they are backed up by national legislation and regulation.

These domestic legal frameworks are crucial building blocks to measure, report, verify and manage greenhouse gas emissions. And the ambition must be that they are ratcheted up in the coming years so that the intent in Paris is realized to pursue efforts to try to limit global temperature rises to 1.5C, and ""well below"" 2C above pre-industrial levels, the level scientists say we must not breach if we are to avoid the worst risks of global warming.

This is a massively ambitious agenda that will require comprehensive and swift actions from governments and business if it is to have any prospect of being achieved. While this is uncertain, the fact remains that the 2015 Paris deal created a window for it to happen, and what is now needed is leadership from the public and private sectors to ensure effective implementation, and holding them to account so that the treaty truly delivers.

Nicola Kimm, head of sustainability, environment, health and safety at Philips Lighting, said: ¡°If we look around us, we see an ever increasing need for more energy. Through the sales of our energy efficient lighting, we contribute to reducing lighting¡¯s share of all global electricity consumption from the current 15 percent level to 8 percent in 2030.

NEWS,Saudi Arabia,"September 25, 2017",NEWS,"Arab News (Jedda, Saudi Arabia) ","   An areal view shows the Maldives capital Male, pictured on Dec. 14, 2009. (Reuters)   NEW YORK: Speaking on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly in New York last week, Mohamed Shainee said that relations between the Republic of Maldives and Saudi Arabia are ¡°at their best for a very long time¡± ? and he should know.
Shainee is the Maldives minister for fisheries and agriculture, two important parts of the economy of the string of 1,100 islands and atolls that make up Asia¡¯s smallest country.

But he is also charged with a special responsibility for matters relating to Saudi Arabia, he said, and has accompanied the Maldives President Abdulla Yameen on several official visits to the Kingdom.

¡°King Salman visited our country when he was still crown prince in 2013, and there has been a close relationship ever since that. We have some things in common ? we are two of the most predominantly Islamic countries in the world, with very high proportions of Muslims in the population. Since he came, there has been a very good exchange of ideas and understandings,¡± Shainee said.

Saudis are attracted by the Maldives¡¯ balmy tropical climate and its beaches, considered among the finest in the world and a lure for tourists of every nationality. But the relationship has also blossomed into a stronger economic partnership, with Saudi Arabia increasingly playing the part of investor in and developer of the Maldives¡¯ economy.

The Kingdom has been a benefactor to the Maldives for some time, putting money into the building of an airport in the 1970s, along with other development work like sewage and water supply, and helping meet the bill for reconstruction of the islands¡¯ infrastructure after the devastation caused by the 2004 tsunami, in which Shainee was very personally involved.

Official figures show that assistance from Saudi Arabia totalled nearly SR300 million ($80 million) up to 2010, but this has accelerated since, with SR722 million pledged since for hospitals and other development.

By far the biggest chunk will go on the planned upgrade to Velana International Airport, where a $357 million contract has been awarded to the Saudi Binladin contracting group.

The airport upgrade is vital for the Maldives¡¯ future because, regardless of the importance of fisheries and agriculture sectors in Shainee¡¯s portfolio, tourism is by far the biggest part of the islands¡¯ economy, accounting for about 30 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) and 60 percent of foreign exchange earnings.

Work begins on the project later this year, and when it is completed it will allow the airport to cater for up to 7 million people a year, compared with 1.5 million now. By comparison, the native population of the islands is about 350,000 people.

The airport development is a central part of an economic strategy that also envisages the creation ? with Saudi support ? of special economic zones, to encourage businesses like shipping and finance, that have not previously been a feature of economic life there. Tourism-related activities in these zones will be kept to a maximum of 20 percent.

Chinese investors have also been active in the islands, leading some commentators to claim there is a ¡°race¡± between Saudi Arabia and China to develop the Maldives¡¯ economy and have influence in the affairs of the strategically important islands, in the Indian Ocean between India and Africa.

Shainee said the country¡¯s investment authorities would choose on the basis of whichever was best for the country. ¡°Maldivans are very nationalistic,¡± he said.

There were allegations of protectionist motives on the part of some Maldivans earlier this year, when a $10 billion Saudi project to develop the Faafu Atoll was put on hold. The opposition said that the atoll had been ¡°sold¡± to Saudi Arabia, but Shainee pointed out that the land would have remained under Maldives¡¯ laws and sovereignty, and would have been developed with social, medical and educational facilities, for the benefit of the country.

Business people from the Arabian Gulf are already active in the Maldives¡¯ hotel industry, with luxury property owned or run by the Four Seasons, Jumeirah and One & Only groups, in conjunction with local partners.

Apart from development, the other vital issue, in which Shainee also has a special interest, is the environment. The islands are among the lowest inhabited places on earth, with an average height of only 1.5 meters above sea level, and the inhabitants of the populated 187 islands face constant threat from rising sea levels.

The Maldives was among the first countries to bring the issue of rising sea levels to world attention in the 1980s, but Shainee is optimistic that solutions to the seemingly intractable problem are at hand.

¡° is of course a very serious issue, but I do not think we can worry too much about rising sea levels. It is true that we are very low lying, but look at the Netherlands. There a lot of the country is below sea level, but it has survived,¡± Shainee said.

He is hoping that the Maldives can promote its own kind of solution to environmental problems from the international stage. The country has been on the UN human rights and  councils in the past, and is currently lobbying to join the powerful UN Security Council. The country also chairs the international Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS).

Shainee believes that there are other things that can be done to alleviate the effect of rising sea levels. ¡°It is essential to promote healthy oceans and sustainable fisheries, which gives the coral and sea life a change to adapt to the new environment,¡± he added.

He was speaking from the heart. He is the son and grandson of fishermen, and began his career as a fisherman before entering government service. Shainee retains a close affinity with the oceanic world, and is proud of his postgraduate work in Norway and Canada in new techniques for fisheries protection. The Maldives is a leading member of the UN coalition to save shark species, and has declared the islands a no-fishing zone for endangered sharks.

In the aftermath of the 2004 tsunami, when 80 percent of the islands had been underwater and 60 percent of the economy was affected, Shainee was charged with distributing financial aid to parts of the far-flung islands by boat and sea-plane, with a suitcase full of currency handcuffed to his wrist.

¡°The islands were very badly affected, but there was a comparatively low loss of life. We are a seafaring people and we knew instinctively what to do,¡± he said. Copyright: Arab News ",Saudi Arabia on course in big Maldives investment program
Junjie Zhang,China,"July 28, 2017",News,"China Daily (Beijing, China) ","China is already experiencing the effects of . According to the Third National Assessment Report on , the average temperature of China's land area rose by 0.9 Celsius to 1.5 C from 1909 to 2011, which is higher than the global average. It is projected to rise another 1.3 C to 5 C by the end of this century.
Besides temperature rise,  has had other observable effects on China, such as rising sea levels, melting glaciers, changing precipitation patterns, more droughts and heat waves, and increasing risks of hurricanes.  therefore has a significant effect on China's natural environment and economic growth.

Due to its complex climate conditions and fragile ecosystems, China is sensitive to , with its agriculture being particularly vulnerable.

Although  will improve thermal conditions for agricultural production in some areas, the negative impacts are more pronounced. They include declining crop quality and yield, decreasing arable land quality, increasing price of water and fertilizers, aggravated crop pests and diseases, and more frequent and intense extreme climate events. It is widely believed the net effect of  on agriculture is negative.

 therefore poses a huge challenge to the stability and sustainability of food production in China. Agriculture employs about 40 percent of China's population; it also produces 30 percent of rice, 17 percent of wheat, and 20 percent of corn in the world. The climatic shocks to agriculture will not only threaten the food security of the world's largest population, but also have a ripple effect on the global food market.

All these call for thorough assessment of the economic impacts of  on China's agriculture and a strategy to address the challenge.

The cost of  on China's agriculture has been assessed in a recent paper published in the Journal of Environmental Economics and Management by researchers from Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Duke Kunshan University and the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences. The report's authors say  is likely to decrease the yields of rice, wheat and corn in China, and the authorities need to take urgent actions to deal with the challenge.

The impacts of  on the three staple crops are heterogeneous across Chinese regions. While  is harmful for rice production in southern China, it is beneficial in northern China. Additionally, the major rice-producing provinces, such as Hunan, Hubei, Jiangsu, and Jiangxi, will suffer significant losses.

For wheat, northeastern China could benefit from . And while Central China, including several counties in Henan, Shandong and Hebei provinces, will suffer moderate losses, the impact of  on southern China will be severe.

When it comes to corn, all regions show the negative impacts of , except for some counties in the Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region. In particular, the major corn-producing provinces, such as Jilin, Heilongjiang, Henan and Hebei, will be severely affected.

The impacts of  on rice, wheat, and corn productions are of great economic significance. And evidence suggests  can endanger China's food security. Domestic food production is likely to decline if advanced technology and improved farming methods cannot fill the supply gap caused by . And if China has to rely, even if partly, on the world market for food security, it cannot achieve self-sufficiency in food production, which is a top priority for the Chinese government.

Given the impacts of  and potential risks, China needs to take immediate measures to deal with eventualities. Adaptation can help China mitigate the negative impacts of  and benefit from the positive impacts. According to the findings of a study, China's National Technology Needs Assessment for  Adaptation, funded by the World Bank, the priority adaptive measures include stress-tolerant varietal breeding, precision agricultural technology, and agricultural water-saving technology. By promoting these climate-friendly agricultural technologies, China can reduce the climate risks on food security.

Wang Yanfei,China,"January 17, 2017",News,"China Daily (Beijing, China) ","China is capable of taking a leadership role in combating global  as well as being open toward collaborating with all countries to achieve economic restructuring, China's special envoy for  said.
Xie Zhenhua, a veteran  negotiator who has participated in United Nations conferences on the subject, said China is taking steps to fulfill pledges made in the Paris  agreement of 2015 by promoting industrial upgrades and using more clean energy.

China has pledged to cut its emissions per unit of GDP by 60 to 65 percent by 2030 from its 2005 level, according to the Paris pact.

As part of efforts to implement the goal, China will launch a nationwide carbon trading market on schedule this year, Xie said in an exclusive interview with China Daily. Carbon trading refers to the buying and selling of carbon permits and credits to emit carbon dioxide.

""The carbon trade will ensure transparency and will be operated based on market principles,"" he said.

The special envoy said legislation on carbon trading is expected to be enacted by the end of the year.

""China's firm attitude to engage in global  actions will inject confidence amid a rising division between pro-globalization and anti-globalization,"" said Xie.

The 68-year-old, who served as China's environmental protection chief between 1993 and 2005, was appointed as the special envoy for  in 2015.

Xie made the comments ahead of the World Economic Forum at Davos, Switzerland.  was expected to attract much attention, since the Paris agreement, reached in 2015, will have a long-term impact on the transformation of economic structures worldwide.

The Davos forum comes at a time when the United States could withdraw from the Paris pact and policies including trade have added uncertainty to global affairs. This has led to expectations that China will play a more significant role, said Robert Hormats, vice-chairman of the consulting company Kissinger Associates and a former undersecretary of state for economic growth, energy and the environment.

But Xie said he was not worried about bilateral cooperation with the United States.

""Collaboration on  has never ceased amid the political tensions,"" he said.

Bilateral collaboration continues under the leadership of the US-China  Working Group, and the US-China Climate Smart/Low Carbon Cities Summit will be held in Boston this year, according to Xie.

Xie said he expected US president-elect Donald Trump's attitude toward  to shift after he takes office on Friday. Trump has said he is skeptical of  and might withdraw from the Paris agreement.

""Trump has softened his tone on whether  is real,"" he said, noting that two weeks after the Nov 8 election, Trump acknowledged that global warming is linked to human activities.

In the meantime, the international community and US citizens will pressure the Trump administration to continue clean energy policies, Xie said.

Former Exxon Mobil CEO Rex Tillerson, Trump's nominee for secretary of state, said last week that  is real and that the consequences of  warrant serious action. More than 600 businesses in the US released a letter last week calling for Trump to take steps to combat .

""Industrial upgrades aiming for more sustainable growth is a global trend,"" said Xie. ""It is not something that can be reversed by a single political leader.""

Donald Trump has often ridiculed global warming and promised to withdraw the United States from the global accord signed in Paris in 2015. Yet despite the change of political weather in Washington, the captains of business and finance gathered in Davos this week will spend a lot of time talking about  - and how to make money from it.

The World Economic Forum is devoting 15 sessions of its 2017 annual meeting to , and nine more to clean energy - the most ever on the issues.

It reflects how much is at stake. For global business leaders, it's not just a question of burnishing their green credentials, but about billions of dollars - maybe even trillions - in potential profits and losses. Insurers are starting to price-in more frequent flooding and droughts; energy giants are shaping their business for a world that's moving away from oil and coal; carmakers are putting real money into electric vehicles; banks want to lend money for renewable electricity projects.

""The good thing is that the Paris agreement raised the bar for everyone,"" said Ben van Beurden, the head of Royal Dutch Shell, Europe's largest oil group. ""Everybody feels the obligation to act.""

Achieving the ambitions set out in Paris may require $13.5 trillion of spending through to 2030, according to International Energy Agency data that shows the scale of the opportunity for business. Only last year, clean energy investment stood at $287.5 billion, data compiled by Bloomberg New Energy Finance indicate.

""The scale and scope of the investment flows on renewables shows it's mainstream,"" said David Turk, head of  at the IEA in Paris and a former senior US climate diplomat.

With moneymaking opportunities rising, traditional  advocates - Al Gore and Greenpeace Executive Director Jennifer Morgan - will mingle in panel discussions with executives such as HSBC Holdings PLC Chairman Stuart Gulliver and Patrick Yu, president of Cofco Corp, the largest food company in China.

Harvey Morris,China,"September 2, 2017",News,"China Daily (Beijing, China) ","Recent catastrophic weather phenomena provide yet more strong evidence that global warming is very much a reality. Typhoons and hurricanes are among the uncontrollable forces of nature that afflict humankind from time to time.
However, scientists warn that these weather phenomena are becoming more frequent and more powerful. Two deadly superstorms late last month, thousands of miles apart, once more raised the question of whether humankind has contributed to this trend through greenhouse gas-induced .

Typhoon Hato, which struck southern China, killing 18 people and forcing thousands to evacuate their homes, was the worst storm to hit the region in half a century. Days later, Hurricane Harvey made landfall in Texas, bringing with it what officials described as ""unprecedented"" flooding to the populous US state. The storm forced the closure of 10 oil refineries that employ tens of thousands of people and normally handle up to 2 million barrels a day.

 skeptics routinely argue that such natural scourges long predate the era in which fossil-fuel burning is said to have accelerated global warming. Research, however, points to human activity playing a role. A US study published last year indicated that typhoons affecting heavily populated regions of East Asia had become up to 15 percent more intense and up to four times more frequent as a result of .

Wei Mei, a marine scientist at the University of South Carolina and co-author of the study, said at the time: ""The intensification is strongest for typhoons that tend to make landfall because of the stronger warming of the coastal waters near East and Southeast Asia."" According to Wei, the typhoons striking the Chinese mainland, Taiwan, Japan and the Korean Peninsula will intensify further because of the faster warming of waters of 20 degrees north.

An update earlier this year from the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory in New Jersey cautiously reported it was premature to conclude that greenhouse gas emissions had already had a detectable impact on Atlantic hurricane or global tropical cyclone activity. However, human activities may have already caused changes that are not yet detectable.

The GFDL said it was likely that by the end of the century manmade global warming would contribute to more intense and destructive storms and there was a better than even chance that there would be more of them.

Similar studies in the past prompted the debate on  and led to a near-global consensus, expressed in last year's Paris  agreement, on taking action to curb the temperature rise.

 deniers are now in a minority, although they received a boost with the election of US President Donald Trump, a climate skeptic. He has suggested in the past that the data behind some  research might have been manipulated. There are now allegations of a cover-up of some research - to favor the  deniers. ExxonMobil, the world's largest energy company, is defending itself against accusations that it downplayed its own research indicating the existence of manmade global warming.

US legal authorities are looking into whether the company misled the public, an allegation which the energy giant denies. ExxonMobil says it now acknowledges that  is real and that it even urged Trump not to pull out of the Paris Agreement, which he nevertheless did.

It is now left to China and the European Union to take the lead to combat , the issue on which the two have shown the greatest solidarity in a more than decade-old partnership.

Some argue that we may already have reached the point of no return, where no amount of reduction of greenhouse gases will prevent potentially catastrophic global warming. That may be overly pessimistic. But data suggesting last year might have been the hottest year on record, coupled with this season's superstorms, are reminders that time for action may be running out.

Chen Weihua,China,"August 11, 2017",News,"China Daily (Beijing, China) ","What happened in the past two weeks has highlighted the world superpower's leadership and its loss of leadership on the climate front.
First it was the release of the documentary An Inconvenient Sequel: Truth to Power on July 28. Former US vice-president Al Gore inspired the whole world in 2006 with his An Inconvenient Truth, which helped him win an Oscar, and the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize.

In the sequel, Gore continues to warn people of the dire fallout of , and also offers hope from increasing global actions, such as in reaching the historic Paris climate agreement in 2015.

An admirer of Gore's work, I was a bit upset watching the movie in the AMC Loews Georgetown due to the poor attendance. I had hoped that such a serious movie would have a box office better than the action movie Wolf Warriors II, which raked in $5 billion in China in 13 days.

After all, 56 percent of Americans named  as a major threat to their country, trailing only the Islamic State group, according to a Pew survey released on Aug 1. But why they are indifferent to the movie?

The Barack Obama administration played a critical role in rallying the world in concluding the Paris Agreement, including teaming up with China, and the two countries played exemplary roles in securing the agreement.

However, US President Donald Trump has been busy reversing course. On June 1, he announced the US would withdraw from the Paris accord. Last Friday, his administration submitted a letter to UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres officially informing him of the US decision, though still leaving the door open for US reengagement if the terms improve.

Under Obama, the US pledged to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 28 percent over the 2005 levels by 2025. But Trump regards this as bad for the US economy and jobs and he apparently wants to lower the target.

Trump appointed climate denier Scott Pruitt as director of the Environmental Protection Agency, and proposed to cut EPA's budget by a third. Right after taking office, he signed executive orders to revive the controversial Dakota Access and Keystone XL oil pipelines.

He also signed an executive order that aims to rescind Obama's Clean Power Plan that caps the amount of greenhouse gases from power plants.

The news this week is that the US Agriculture Department has advised employees to avoid the term """" and "" adaption"" and to instead use ""weather extremes"" and ""resilience to weather extremes"".

Meanwhile, a draft government report on  is awaiting the the Trump administration's approval. In the report, scientists from 13 federal agencies conclude that people in the US are already feeling the effects of  primarily due to human activities.

There is a fierce tug-of-war going on in the US on the climate front. While the Trump administration is reversing course, people like California Governor Jerry Brown have stepped up. Brown talked with President Xi Jinping about cooperation on , right after Trump's announcement to withdraw from the Paris accord. Brown praised Xi for his leadership on  when talking on NBC's Meet the Press on Sunday.

China has made a great leap forward in developing clean and renewable energy in recent years, becoming by far the world's top renewable electricity producer. Yet that is just the first step in the long march to tackle the country's severe pollution and embarking on a sustainable path of ""clear waters, lush mountains"" in Xi's words.

And all indications are that China remains determined and unwavering despite the US' reversal.

Venkatachalam Anbumozhi,China,"May 20, 2017",News,"China Daily (Beijing, China) ","What happens if the United States is not ready to lead the world in its pursuit of clean energy transition? US President Donald Trump has unnerved the world with his policy moves and public comments, including those on . During his meetings with top world leaders, Trump has ignored  and instead focused on national security and trade. It's another matter that  had been a major area of cooperation among China, the US, the European Union and Japan.
At the start of last year, the US was well positioned to lead the global fight against . But last month Trump issued an executive order, rewriting the previous US administration's Clean Power Plan. He also ordered a recalculation of the social cost of carbon, lifting the moratorium on coal mining on federal land, and that  be disregarded in other areas of national policymaking.

By reversing his predecessor Barack Obama's policies on clean energy and carbon emissions, Trump is rolling back the new model of cooperative global governance embodied in the 2015 Paris climate agreement. The Obama administration had argued that other countries' commitment (along with that of the US) to reducing emissions under the Paris agreement was expected to create a big new market for the US' clean energy companies.

Over the past eight years, the Obama administration and China's leadership succeeded, to a large extent, in prioritizing climate action as part of their bilateral agenda. China became much more cooperative with the US on  since the UN  conference in 2009, and both sides achieved tangible results in reducing emissions and enhancing global cooperation. The US-China Joint Agreement on Technology Cooperation in 2014, for instance, laid the foundation for the Paris agreement a year later.

But the Trump administration's moves will not only prevent the US from playing a leading role in the fight against , but also undermine American interests.

First, as the US veers away from clean energy technology, China is on way to becoming the leading supplier to a rapidly growing global market for clean energy. The Intended Nationally Determined Contributions, embedded in the Paris pact, are expected to generate $20 trillion in new demand for renewable energy and energy efficiency technologies, and if Trump undermines the US clean energy sector, there is a good chance that the clean energy technologies the world uses will come from China.

Second, if Trump downgrades US commitment to the Paris targets, it could give China a cause to slow-walk its own emission reduction, while still claiming the global leadership mantle on emission reductions.

In contrast to the US, China is looking for new partners to take forward its global climate efforts, and President Xi Jinping has vigorously defended the Paris accord, saying it must not be derailed. China is helping drive renewable energy's global expansion, taking the country's actual climate leadership beyond mere rhetoric. Its emission reduction targets are enshrined in the 13th Five-Year Plan (2016-20), with a financial outlay of $360 billion for renewable energy by 2020. It also seems on way to reaching its emission peak five years before schedule. This year the Chinese government will establish a national carbon market, which, with 5 billion tons of carbon trade each year, will be the largest in the world.

Though some 200 countries signed the Paris agreement, G20 countries account for more than 60 percent of the global emissions. Given the heightened financial risks associated with , G20 countries implementing new rules can ensure a smooth transition to a more clean energy economy. China can work with India, Indonesia, Japan, Germany and France to continue to devise a new global cooperation paradigm that takes account of the diverging aspirations of different economies.

Besides, economic trends provide incentives for clean energy actions. Renewable energy generation accounts for the vast majority of new jobs in the energy sector. In fact, the solar and wind power sector employs more people than the highly automated coal, oil and gas industries combined.

Also, private sector players across the world are making the clean energy transition all but inevitable, and their agendas will not change simply because the US has started thinking differently. As long as this remains the case, China and other emerging economies will continue to pursue the clean energy transition.

These are difficult times, but collectively we can decide what kind of world we want to live in.

Op Rana,China,"November 18, 2017",News,"China Daily (Beijing, China) ","Not much was expected to come out of the UN  Conference in Bonn, Germany, after US President Donald Trump pulled out of the Paris Agreement.
And not much seems to have been achieved at the annual gathering of global climate negotiators, which was scheduled to end on Friday but dragged into the wee hours of Saturday.

However, many see a silver lining in the dark clouds of global warming, because a new alliance of 19 countries committed on Thursday to quickly phasing out coal, which was welcomed by many as a ""political watershed"" that signaled the beginning of the ""end of the dirtiest fossil fuel"". New promises were made by Angola, Denmark, Mexico and New Zealand for the ""Powering Past Coal Alliance"", led by the United Kingdom and Canada.

German Chancellor Angela Merkel, addressing the conference, emphasized that the response to  would determine the destiny of humankind and urged accelerated action to mitigate and adapt to .

French President Emannuel Macron, who has emerged as a new climate champion and the most vocal critic of Trump, said France would try to bridge the funding gap for the UN Intergovernmental Panel on  created by the withdrawal of the United States, and urged its European Union partners to do the same.

And on Wednesday, governments for the first time acknowledged they can play a leading role in protecting forests and reserved natural habitats, and keep temperature rise at a ""safe level"", which indigenous peoples' groups saw as a victory.

These ""first peoples"", long marginalized, also seem to have achieved breakthroughs in terms of official international recognition of their rights, autonomy and participation in negotiations.

This is important as the territories of these groups, whose combined population is about 370 million, contain 20 percent of the carbon of the world's tropical forests which they often have to defend against loggers, farmers and miners.

Besides, less-developed countries succeeded in brokering a resolution on Wednesday to ensure the final document will put pressure on rich countries to take action on carbon cuts and climate finance.

Now down to the brass tacks.

Instead of accepting the less-developed countries' proposal to discuss the pledges made by the rich economies to fight , the conference agreed to seven measures to monitor the rich nations' actions, including urging UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres to make efforts to persuade the majority of the parties to ratify the Doha Amendment to the Kyoto Protocol, work out a process to track and report on the progress made to meet pre-2020 commitments including taking stock in 2018 and 2019, and assess the funds rich economies contribute to help the poor ones to cope with .

That means no consensus yet on ratifying the Doha Amendment to the Kyoto Protocol, without which keeping global temperature rise to below 2 C will be impossible.

All this shows the consensus is on compromise, not climate action. And Aziz Mekouar, Moroccan ambassador to the climate talks who brokered the talks, said as much in his remark: ""People were really constructive and willing to reach a compromise.""

Amid all this comes a dire warning from more than 15,000 scientists from over 180 countries that: ""Time is running out"" to stop business as usual because the threats posed by rising greenhouse gas emissions on biodiversity loss are pushing the biosphere toward disaster.

The new warning, published in BioScience on Monday, is an update to the ""World Scientists' Warning to Humanity"" issued by about 1,700 leading scientists 25 years ago. That the 1992 warning that the planet was on its way to being ""irretrievably mutilated"" went largely unheeded should give us an idea about what to expect in the future.

And it's anybody's guess whether the climate skeptics and deniers will be swayed by the latest warning or heed the words of 12-year-old Timoci Naulusala from Fiji who, speaking in Bonn about the impact of last year's Cyclone Winston, said: ""My home, my school, sources of food, money, water were totally destroyed. My once beautiful village, which I called home, is a barren waste.  is real, not a dream.""

Zhao Huanxin,China,"November 9, 2017",News,"China Daily (Beijing, China) ","With a new round of UN  Conference being held in Bonn, Germany, from Monday to Nov 17, and with US President Donald Trump visiting China from Wednesday through Friday, many people feel nostalgic about those days when Beijing and Washington took the lead in pushing for and formally signed the 2015 Paris Agreement, showing a good example of big powers joining hands to meet global challenges.
So it is encouraging to hear the rising voices calling for China and the United States to ramp up cooperation on  despite Trump's decision in June to withdraw from the Paris climate accord and focus instead on bolstering the US' fossil fuel industry.

In Bonn, government delegates and experts are working on a ""rule book"" for the Paris Agreement, which seeks to end the fossil fuel era in the second half of the century by shifting the world economy to such cleaner energy as wind and solar power, according to a Reuters report.

A week before the crucial Bonn conference, China's chief  negotiator, Xie Zhenhua, expressed hope that Washington would stay in the Paris accord and contribute to the global agenda on fighting . China has made it clear that it's willing to deepen collaboration with the US in areas such as clean energy, energy and resource conservation, and carbon capture and storage, said Xie, who is attending the Bonn meeting.

David Dollar, senior fellow at John L. Thornton China Center at the Brookings Institution, told me in an interview that the ballast in Sino-US relations is their cooperation on the global public goods, the most important of which are free trade and . Without successful cooperation on issues that matter to the global public, bilateral ties will likely become more volatile and bounce back and forth on trivialities, Dollar said.

And last week, Cui Tiankai, Beijing's top envoy in Washington, said that many international community members have pinned hopes on the US and China playing their due parts in addressing global challenges.

It is interesting to note that on Nov 3, the day when Trump left for his 12-day trip to Asia, a major US government report affirmed that global warming is real and is ""extremely likely"" caused by human activities, a stark contrast with Trump's position on . Also noteworthy is the passion of US businesses and many states in pursuing green development and expanding cooperation with China, which will lead to mitigating greenhouse gas emissions.

Of the 29 company CEOs accompanying Trump on his visit to China, 10 are engaged in liquefied natural gas or other energy fields, raising the prospect of deals on liquefied natural gas, which causes less pollution than coal, according to a Xinhua report.

Jerry Brown, governor of California, which is the largest economy among US states, champions sub-national cooperation in . He visited China in early June to sign agreements with the Ministry of Science and Technology and two provincial governments to work together on reducing emissions.

Last Tuesday, UN Environment Programme Executive Director Erik Solheim said: ""In all likelihood, the United States of America will live up to its Paris commitment, not because of the White House, but because of the private sector... All the big American companies are dedicated to go in the green direction.""

That coincides with the trend in China, where green development was highlighted at the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, which drew up a blueprint for the country's economic growth in the next five years. The matched trends hopefully mean a broad prospect of  cooperation between China, the US and the rest of the world.

Wang Can,China,"September 4, 2017",News,"China Daily (Beijing, China) ","Despite being caught in the dilemma of poverty alleviation through economic development and environmental protection, the BRICS countries have still adopted efficient measures for a greener planet.
BASIC countries - Brazil, South Africa, India and China - which were formed in November 2009 before the Copenhagen climate summit, are four members of BRICS and also a vital negotiation mechanism to deepen talks on  cooperation. The four committed to act jointly at the Copenhagen climate summit, including insistence on the principle of equity and common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities, as well as a possible united resistance if their common minimum position was not met by the developed nations. These four countries actively foster the negotiation progress of the United Nations Framework Convention on  and act as key forces to serve developing countries' fundamental interests, put forward South-South cooperation and explore North-South cooperation.

Besides, BASIC countries have a vital role in making the Paris conference a success. In June 2015, the EU-China joint statement on  was signed, clearly stipulating that efficient protocols would be reached during the conference and Intended Nationally Determined Contributions would also be improved. In September 2015, the US-China Joint Presidential Statement on  pledged that relative domestic policies would be implemented, which also injected strong momentum for the Paris conference to record historical achievements. What the bloc has been dedicated to on  issues are widely acknowledged and respected by the international community.

As the first echelon of emerging economies, BRICS countries' exploration for a low carbon development pattern may offer valuable experience for other countries to learn from. As for the INDC, this is a term used under the UNFCC for reductions in greenhouse gas emissions that all countries that signed the convention were asked to publish in the lead up to the Paris conference. The INDC of the largest greenhouse gas emitters included China, which targeted a 60 to 65 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions per unit of GDP by 2030 compared with the amount of 2005. China's strong commitment shows the determination to shoulder its own international liability and not only raises stricter requirements for innovating the domestic development pattern, it also sets a great example for other countries who pursue the path of low carbon development.

The most important international cooperation beyond the protocol is South-South cooperation. For example, Brazil has offered solid help for developing a Clean Development Mechanism and preservation of the Amazon. South Africa actively fosters cooperation among the Indian Ocean Rim Association and the New Asian - African Strategic Partnership. China offered large amounts of assistance in kind and equipment for developing countries and also provided great support for deepening international negotiations on , policy planning and personnel training.

Laurence Tubiana,China,"June 13, 2017",News,"China Daily (Beijing, China) ","US President Donald Trump has withdrawn the United States from the 2015 Paris  agreement, the landmark United Nations treaty that many of us worked so hard to achieve. Trump is making a mistake that will have grave repercussions for his country as well as the rest of the world.
Trump claims that he will try to renegotiate the deal reached in Paris, or craft a new one. But leaders from around the world have already hailed the agreement as a breakthrough in the fight against , a victory for international cooperation, and a boon to the global economy.

Among the many challenges we face today,  is unique in its global scale. It affects every element of life on this planet - from ecosystems and food production to cities and industrial supply chains. Viewing  as strictly an ""environmental"" problem misses the point entirely.

We might charitably assume that Trump simply does not understand the implications of his decision. And yet, regardless of what he thinks, we know that he is surrounded by advisers who know very well what is at stake.

On the campaign trail, Trump promised to create jobs and protect US workers from the ravages of the world. But his decision undermines every one of those goals, and it goes against the wishes of a vast majority of Americans, including many of his own supporters. By turning his back on the Paris agreement, he is increasing the US' exposure to the devastating effects of  - many of which they are already experiencing. Moreover, he is undercutting jobs in the thriving renewable-energy and electric-vehicle sectors, which are increasingly employing the very workers he purports to represent.

When I was a member of the French government participating in a global tour to build consensus for climate action - an effort that culminated in the Paris agreement - I experienced firsthand what US leadership can achieve. It is tragic to watch that force for good be subverted by denial and myopia.

By burying their heads in the sand, Trump and his advisers must be hoping that reality will simply go away. They have somehow concluded that the US will be spared from the droughts already destroying farms in California's Central Valley, the rising sea levels already flooding coastal cities, the storms and wildfires routinely ravaging vast swathes of the US countryside, and the water- and food-supply disruptions that threaten us all.

Other parties to the Paris agreement have responded to Trump's decision with strength, thus proving the resilience of the agreement itself.

The world's response will be clear at the G20 Summit in Germany in July. Already, the European Union, China, India, Canada, and Pacific Rim and South American countries have recommitted to the goals of the Paris agreement.

Trump's decision is completely at odds with the current global atmosphere of cooperation. The world's major economies are reaching new agreements every day to collaborate on research and development, infrastructure investment and industrial strategy. They are working together to achieve a low-carbon economy, and to make 2020 the year that global greenhouse gas emissions will have peaked.

EU leaders are already meeting with their Indian and Chinese counterparts to find areas where they can cooperate on developing clean energy and green infrastructure. Massive investments will be made in these areas, and the European Central Bank, the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, and many other institutions are devising mechanisms to finance them.

Even the most optimistic among us did not predict that the old fossil-fuel paradigm would change so quickly. But Europe is phasing out coal-fueled energy production. And India, China, and the Republic of Korea are rapidly shifting their investments away from coal, and toward renewable-energy sources.

Worldwide, the competition is about ""who can go green the fastest.""

It is a shame that Trump has decided to shirk the US' global responsibility and turn his back on these developments. His decision is a blow to so many people - including a great many Americans - who have worked hard to be a successful part of the new economy.

Still, Trump cannot take all of the US with him. State- and city-level climate action is sweeping across the US, increasing in scale and ambition. Trump's historic mistake represents an obstacle to that collective action; but it can hardly stop it. Just as Chinese companies are now training US coal workers to build wind farms, the rest of the world will continue to work together, and build the markets and workforce of the future.

News,China,"May 25, 2017",News,"China Daily (Beijing, China) "," - The vast majority of people say they are ready to make changes to their standard of living if it will prevent future climate catastrophe, a survey on global threats found on Wednesday.
The survey of more than 8,000 people in eight countries - the United States, China, India, the United Kingdom, Australia, Brazil, South Africa and Germany - found that 84 percent of people now consider  a ""global catastrophic risk"".

That puts worry about  only slightly behind fears about large-scale environmental damage and the threat of politically motivated violence escalating into war, according to the Global Challenges Foundation, which commissioned the Global Catastrophic Risks 2017 report.

But it indicates that many people now see  as a bigger threat than other traditional or rising concerns such as epidemics, population growth, use of weapons of mass destruction and the rise of artificial intelligence threats.

On climate and environmental issues, ""there's certainly a huge gap between what people expect from politicians and what politicians are doing. It's stunning,"" said Mats Andersson, vice chairman of the Stockholm-based foundation, in a telephone interview with the Thomson Reuters Foundation.

The survey, released in advance of this week's G7 summit of advanced economies in Italy, also found that 85 percent of people think the United Nations needs reforms to be better equipped to address global threats.

About 70 percent of those surveyed said they think it may be time to create a new global organization - with power to enforce its decisions - specifically designed to deal with a wide range of global risks. Nearly 60 percent said they would be prepared to have their country give up some level of sovereignty to make that happen.

""Whether it's the specter of nuclear conflict over North Korea or the planet tipping into catastrophic , the need for effective global cooperation has never been greater,"" Andersson said.

The Global Challenges Foundation, created in 2012 by a Swedish risk specialist and philanthropist, looks for more effective solutions to cross-border problems and ways to resolve the mismatch between long-term problems and short-term political and market focuses.

Following the G7 meeting, US President Donald Trump is expected to make a decision about whether to pull the US out of the 2015 Paris Agreement on , aimed at keeping global temperature increases to relatively safe levels.

But the foundation found that 84 percent of US citizens it surveyed would be prepared to make changes in their current living standards if it would prevent future climate catastrophes, such as irreversible melting of Arctic and Greenland ice, with accompanying large-scale sea level rise.

That environmental issues and  now rank near the top of global worries about catastrophic threats for many people suggests ""something has shifted in the past couple of years"", Andersson said. ""I really hope that political leaders will realize the mandate they seem to have to act.""

Wang Yanfei,China,"November 1, 2017",News,"China Daily (Beijing, China) ","Nation hopes US will return to Paris agreement on 

China will look to cooperate further with the United States on  negotiations and press ahead with its own green goals despite the US decision to withdraw from the Paris agreement earlier this year, a top official said on Tuesday.

Speaking ahead of the key United Nations climate conference in Bonn, Germany, in November, Xie Zhenhua, the country's chief negotiator on the Paris climate accord, said China will always remain committed to fulfilling its climate pledges and is keen to push the Paris pact with other parties, including the United States.

""China hopes to strengthen cooperation with the US on developing clean energy, carbon capture technologies and other issues. Our cooperation with the US at the state level has progressed quite well and never stopped,"" he said.

The two nations had played key roles in clinching the landmark pact in 2015, but the US administration announced its decision to withdraw from the agreement earlier this year.

""We hope the US will come back to the big family of the Paris agreement and tackle climate challenges with other parties,"" he said.

Though the remaining signatories of the Paris pact will continue their negotiations in Bonn on how to take the pact forward, the meeting would be overshadowed by the stance taken by the US, one of the world's largest carbon emitters.

The United States will still send a team to the Bonn talks, despite its earlier decision to withdraw from the accord.

Zou Ji, president of the China office of Energy Foundation, said he does not expect a major shift in the US stance before the climate conference or during US President Trump's visit to Beijing, which is set to begin on Nov 8 and overlaps the conference.

But deals are expected to be sealed in clean energy during upcoming meetings, like in LNG trade, which can benefit the climate accord, said Zou.

Amid uncertainties brought by the United States, China's strong commitment to combat  challenges is injecting confidence to the coming climate talks, according to Laurence Tubiana, CEO of the European Climate Foundation.

She said China is taking a leading role in the global fight to combat , reflected by the nation's efforts taken in recent years to rebalance its economic structure and lessen reliance on smokestack industries.

China's carbon intensity, a measure of how much carbon the nation emits per GDP, has declined by 4 percent in the first three quarters of this year, according to data from the National Development and Reform Commission, the country's top economic planner.

China is well on track to achieve its carbon emission targets set for the 13th Five-Year Plan (2016-20), according to Li Gao, an official from the  department of the commission.

wangyanfei@chinadaily.com.cn",Beijing vows to honor green goals
Op Rana,China,"November 23, 2017",News,"China Daily (Beijing, China) ","On a staid note, that's how the UN  Conference ended in Bonn, Germany, over the weekend, framing just the skeleton of the rulebook of the 2015 Paris Agreement and leaving it to the 2018 climate conference in Poland to put flesh and muscles on it.
Many believe the Paris climate accord, if implemented to the letter, will keep the rise of global temperatures to below 2 degrees Celsius by the end of this century. But contrary to popular belief, the Paris pact is important not because of its science, but because of its timing and framework. The targets each country agreed to keep the global temperature rise to 2 C were not binding. And since the global temperature will rise to 3 C - at the least - even if all the countries meet their targets, the world needed the Paris Agreement.

Moreover, as the Paris pact cannot be implemented without a rulebook, which in turn has to be completed by 2018, world leaders have no choice but to get their acts together to finalize it by next year's climate conference. And while finalizing the rulebook, the negotiators must keep the needs of the vulnerable countries in mind, and ensure the rich nations pay their promised share of funds and transfer the necessary technologies to poorer countries to help them adapt to and combat .

The Bonn conference was not altogether sedate though; it had its high points, such as when 12-year-old Fijian boy Timoci Naulusala gave an emotional yet calm description of how Cyclone Winston devastated his village last year. His most emphatic words: "" is real, not a dream.""

Fiji, in a way, characterized the conference as delegates adopted the ""Talanoa Dialogue"". Under this Fijian concept, negotiators listen to each other, respect each other's opinions, and seek solutions that benefit everyone. Which came as a surprise, because isn't that what the climate negotiators were supposed to be doing in the first place?

Dialogue brings us to US President Donald Trump. Not satisfied by just pulling out of the Paris Agreement, Trump sent a delegation to Bonn to promote ""clean coal"". Leading Trump's charge were White House energy aide George David Banks and officials from Peabody, the US coal company that for years has, as court documents show, been funding climate deniers. Their attempt to promote coal, however, drew boos and jeers from the delegates, many of whom walked out of the White House-sponsored panel discussion.

Still, the sad reality is, even though the US cannot formally withdraw from the Paris Agreement before November 2020 - when Trump's presidency will perhaps, given the opinion polls, practically end - without Washington contributing its share to the Climate Fund, it will be difficult for the other rich economies to fill the fund gap.

Climate organizations, NGOs and environmentalists have already been criticizing the slow progress made by the rich countries, and, as things stand today, the rich economies will not have contributed $100 billion to the fund by 2020.

Worse, the increasing use of coal in the United States and large emerging countries, including India among others, is likely to push global temperature rise to above 2 C well before 2100. Unfortunately, an end to this trend cannot be seen even on the distant horizon. By the way, if air pollution caused by greenhouse gas emissions is not drastically curbed, the horizon, as we know it, will be seen only in photographs.

The Paris climate talks gave the indication that perhaps dirty fossil fuels were on their way out. Ironically, the next climate talks will be held in Katowice in Poland, a country that is highly dependent on coal due to geographical and economic factors.

Will Katowice make good on the climate promise? Or, like other climate meetings, will it end with a whimper? We have to wait for the curtains to fall on that story.

Zhao Huanxin,China,"December 21, 2017",News,"China Daily (Beijing, China) ","The divergence of policies and priorities of the world's two largest economies in combating  stood in stark contrast on Monday. In Beijing, where improving air quality has become a major policy priority, China's top economic planner unveiled plans for a national carbon market - likely the world's largest - where enterprises can trade their emissions credits. It is another bold step the country is taking to deliver on its Paris Agreement promises.
In contrast, Washington policy observers were quick to point out that the new US National Security Strategy released by the White House on Monday had removed  from the list of worldwide threats menacing the United States. It was a significant departure from the Barack Obama administration, which described  as an ""urgent and growing threat"" to US national security.

The initial phase of China's carbon trading program is expected to cover 1,700 power plants, which emit 3.3 billion metric tons of carbon annually, or about one-third of the nation's total emissions, according to the National Development and Reform Commission.

Additional sectors such as cement and aluminum will be phased in over the coming years, the Environmental Defense Fund said in a release on Tuesday.

""The world has never before seen a climate program on this scale,"" said Fred Krupp, president of the New York-based organization, which provided technical assistance to China's carbon trading pilot programs. ""It's important that the world's largest emitter should lead on climate, and that is precisely what China is doing by launching its national emissions trading system.""

In its latest Global Energy Outlook released earlier this month, the International Energy Agency predicted China's coal use, which peaked in 2013, is set to decline by almost 15 percent by 2040.

China's policy choices will play a huge role in determining global trends and could spark a faster clean-energy transition, the IEA noted.

In a speech at the landmark 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China in October, General Secretary Xi Jinping vowed to promote green development and ramp up the campaign to prevent and control air pollution.

The country is also transitioning toward a more services-based economy, which the IEA said ""is moving the energy sector in a new direction"".

The IEA's outlook says stringent fuel-efficiency measures for cars and trucks, and a push for 1 in 4 cars being electric by 2040, means that China is no longer the main driving force behind global oil use.

It further projected China's carbon emissions to plateau at 9.2 gigatonnes, only slightly above the current level, by 2030, which means it'll meet the promise it made when signing the Paris climate pact in 2015.

It is noticeable that on Monday the IEA published its Coal 2017 report, cautioning that coal use will see a decade-long period of stagnation, with the share of the fossil fuel in the global energy mix forecast to decline to 26 percent in 2022.

Back in Washington, the omission of  as a national security threat in President Donald Trump's first National Security Strategy is a logical follow-up to the  skeptical administration's effort to roll back the rules and regulations of the Obama administration, which were designed to reduce carbon emissions, including those from coal-fired power plants.

And that is a source for concern, as US Senator Michael F. Bennet, a Democrat from Colorado, pointed out on Twitter: ""One topic noticeably missing from #NationalSecurity-Strategy: . Bipartisan group of lawmakers have acknowledged#climatechange as a national security threat. @POTUS silence is cause for serious concern.""

Gary Varvel,US,"December 28, 2017",NEWS,"USA TODAY (Arlington, VA) ","White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders recently tweeted, ""Which is the more underreported story of @POTUS year one? Defeat of ISIS. Booming Trump economy""
She asked the question for good reason. The good news of Trump's presidency hasn't received much attention. According to the Media Research Center, coverage of Trump on the ABC, CBS and NBC evening newscasts in September, October and November was more than 90% negative.
Granted, the president is partially at fault for the lack of positive coverage. At times, he has stepped all over his message. Plus, attacking news reports as ""fake news"" is not the way to win friends and influence the press.
Trump supporters cry foul, but just like a coach who throws a chair or blasts the media in a news conference, the outburst tends to get more attention than it does wins.
Trumpsters aren't the only ones who've noticed how the media treat Trump. Surprisingly, 93-year-old former president Jimmy Carter told New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd: ""I think the media have been harder on Trump than any other president certainly that I've known about.""
Are Trump's wins underreported? Ross Douthat, writing in The Times this month on the ISIS defeat, said ""the media is not adequately reporting an important success because it does not fit into the narrative of Trumpian disaster in which our journalistic entities are all invested.""
Other Trump wins this year include:
Tax cuts: Congress has passed a tax overhaul, but just the anticipation of tax reform, which will cut the corporate rate to 21%, has excited business owners and fueled stock market records.
Economic growth: The gross domestic product has grown by more than 3% for two quarters in a row.
Consumer confidence: In October, consumer confidence rose to the highest level in 17 years, according to the New York-based Conference Board.
Deregulation: Trump has cut 67 Obama-era regulations and added only three new rules. The rollback has spurred business confidence, economic activity and stock market growth. Trump said the actions have saved $8.1 billion in lifetime net regulatory costs.
Stock market: The Dow has set record highs 70 times this year, rising 5,000 points in a year for the first time in history.
Judicial appointments: Trump has staffed the judiciary with constitutionalists such as Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch.
Unemployment: Trump inherited low unemployment from President Obama, but the number of people collecting unemployment benefits has continued to fall to a near 44-year low.
Trade: Trump secured a trade deal with China, Vietnam and South Korea.
Israel: The United States' relationship with Israel has been much improved since the last administration.
Immigration: In August, illegal border crossing apprehensions were down 41% on the Southern border compared with August 2016.
U.S. energy: The Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines are under construction. Jobs to be created: 42,000.
Coal: Trump stopped Obama's war on coal.

: Trump said he will withdraw from the Paris  agreement because it would undermine our economy.
Schools: Trump is giving the green light to school choice programs.
Obamacare: The new tax law repeals its individual mandate.
Of course, the left credits Obama for ISIS' defeat and the booming economy. And Obama recently thanked himself for economic growth and job creation in a speech to mayors in Chicago.
Actually, he deserves some credit. His policies created a slow recovery, which forced businesses to get lean. Trump has removed the regulatory weight and the economy is soaring.
Trump's combative style reminds me of a certain three-time national champion basketball coach from Indiana. But like that coach, Trump has more wins than losses.

Scott Pruitt, who has sued the EPA 14 times as Oklahoma attorney general, said he believes  is real, despite comments from Trump over the years -- including during his presidential campaign -- that  was a hoax perpetuated by the Chinese to reduce the competitiveness of U.S. manufacturers.
""I do not believe that  is a hoax,"" Pruitt said in response to questions from Sen. Ed Markey, D-Mass., during his confirmation hearing before the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee.
When pressed by Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., Pruitt would not say human activity is the primary cause of . Most scientists say the burning of oil, gas and coal to generate power is the main factor creating . Oil and natural gas are major industries in Oklahoma.
""Science tells us the climate is changing and human activity in some matter impacts that change,"" Pruitt said. ""The ability to measure and pursue the degree and the extent of that impact and what to do about it are subject to continuing debate and dialogue.""
When Sanders asked Pruitt whether he believes the United States must transform its energy system away from fossil fuels to protect future generations from , Pruitt said, ""I believe the EPA has a very important role in regulating the (carbon) emissions.""
Pruitt said he believes the EPA has a vital role to play in protecting public health and the environment. During the presidential campaign, Trump called the EPA's work ""a disgrace.""
""I believe there is a very important role for the Environmental Protection Agency,"" Pruitt said.
Sen. Tom Carper of Delaware, the senior Democrat on the committee, questioned what kind of environmental steward Pruitt would be when the president-elect has attacked the EPA and talked about wanting to get rid of part of the agency.
Pruitt said the EPA is crucial in enforcing clean air and water laws across state lines.
Democrats challenged his ties to polluting industries, his skepticism about the man-made causes of  and the frequent lawsuits he has filed to block the EPA's clean air and water rules.
Sen. Tammy Duckworth, D-Ill., questioned whether Pruitt was giving senators vague, pleasant answers on controversial issues to get through his confirmation hearing.
She said there was a contrast between Pruitt's comments as Oklahoma attorney general criticizing the federal renewable fuel standard and his promise during Wednesday's hearing to carry out that mandate. The renewable fuel standard requires gasoline used by cars and other vehicles to contain a certain amount of renewable fuels.
""Are you that Mr. Pruitt (who criticized the standard) or the Scott Pruitt today who is saying all the right things at his confirmation hearing?"" Duckworth asked.
The agency was created in 1970 by President Richard Nixon to protect human health and the environment.
Pruitt joined a coalition of state attorneys general to sue the EPA over its Clean Power Plan, which aims to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions from coal-fired power plants that contribute to . He sued the agency over regulations to reduce methane emissions -- also linked to  -- from the oil and gas industry.
""Not a single American voted for dirtier air and drinking water, but if Mr. Pruitt takes the helm at the EPA, that's what millions of Americans and thousands of communities will face,"" said Ken Cook, co-founder and president of the Environmental Working Group. ""Every senator, regardless of party, should reject this nomination on behalf of their constituents' health.""
Pruitt's supporters said he will help rein in an agency that has hurt farmers, ranchers and small businesses and the overall U.S. economy with burdensome and costly regulations.

In the aftermath of two huge hurricanes and over 100 immense wildfires in the Western U.S., as a small business advocate I can no longer be silent on an issue threatening small business owners -- .

 is real. It's disastrous. It's getting worse. And it's a danger to small businesses, including yours.
Although I was safely located thousands of miles away, I watched Hurricane Irma and Hurricane Harvey with a personal sense of dread.
More: Rhonda Abrams' column page
I've been fortunate to be invited to work with small business owners in dozens of locations in Irma's and Harvey's paths. I've spent time with the small business communities in St. Thomas, St. Croix, the British Virgin Islands -- all areas hit hard by Hurricane Irma. Many will lose their businesses. Many more will struggle to hang on.
In Florida, I've frequently spoken in Miami as well as to small business communities throughout the state--. I know well the small business consultants of Hillsborough County, Florida, which covers Tampa. They'll be going into overdrive trying to help small businesses recover from Irma -- some of which won't make it, as even minor costs of damage repair (as well as loss of business) will prove to be too much.
I know Texas very well. A few years ago, the Houston Small Business Development Centers brought me on a tour throughout much of the area of South Texas hit by Hurricane Harvey.
These are real people. Real small businesses. And they're being threatened by disasters brought about by a warmer climate. Many will lose their businesses and their livelihoods. Don't expect Federal assistance to save them -- most is in the form of loans, not grants.
It's not just hurricanes. My sister and brother have lived in southern Oregon for three decades. My sister owns a small business there. Summers used to be beautiful, attracting both tourists and locals enjoying outdoor activities under sparkling blue skies. Now, summer after summer, the skies are gray and filled with ash, week after week, from massive forest fires often hundreds of miles away.
Outdoor activities, including boating, fishing, hiking, rafting and even wine tasting are heavily curtailed. The renowned Oregon Shakespeare Festival cancelled some performances due to smoke and ash. Small businesses throughout the West suffer.
This is  in action. And it's only going to get worse unless we all do something about it.
Here's how disasters caused or exacerbated by  are likely to hit your own small business:
1. Higher insurance rates. Wherever you live, you may now find yourself in a disaster-prone area with higher insurance rates. As I write this, tropical storms are now hitting inland areas never before hit by such weather.
2. Loss of business. When a disaster hits, even if your business is thousands of miles away, your suppliers or customers may suffer. Your cash flow and credit will take a hit.
3. Loss of tourist dollars. Tourist areas, such as coastal areas, mountains (think ski areas), forests, are all particularly susceptible to climate-related events. If your business depends on tourists, you're very vulnerable.
4. Fewer resources. Americans pull together after natural disasters, providing both government and private relief. But dollars spent on disaster recovery aren't available to you for small business loans, economic development in your community, purchases in your business.
5. Higher taxes. All this recovery costs governments, and you, money.
What can you do?
1. Admit  is real. There's no longer a scientific debate. The planet is warming, and human activity is contributing to that warming. Natural disasters are getting more intense and more frequent.
2. Reduce your own carbon footprint and waste. This not only saves the planet, it saves you money. Whatever you use, buy, or ship consumes resources. I'm a publisher, and printing and shipping books consumes huge amounts of fossil fuels. We've switched to digital or print-on-demand (which vastly reduces inventory) whenever possible.
3. Demand attention from your elected officials. Let's reduce the likelihood these disasters will keep occurring.

First, we need to tax the ""blue zones."" That is, we need to impose steep taxes on property in coastal areas that will be flooded by the sea-level increases that global warming is supposed to bring. By discouraging people from living or building there now, we'll save ourselves from big problems in the future. Sure it'll drive down property values, but those values should go down -- that property is going to be flooded anyway, remember?
Second, we need to ban taxpayer-funded air travel to conferences. State legislatures could ban reimbursement for travel outside their states; Congress could require that no federal grant money be spent on air travel to conferences and similar events. A lot of academic conferences would fail, but that's a small price to pay for saving the planet.
Third, we need to ban private jet travel. It's nice that Leonardo DiCaprio can jet around the world speaking against , but the carbon emissions involved set a bad example that outweighs anything he might say. So no more private jets. Bigshots will just have to fly commercial like everyone else, the way they did in the 1950s. Politicians, too, should have to fly commercial. No more government-funded ""executive jets"" for them.
Fourth, we need a luxury tax on mansions. Any home more than twice the size of the average American home should be taxed at 25% of its value per year.
I'm sure enterprising members of Congress and state legislatures can come up with more ideas. But the important thing is to set a good example: Treat  like the crisis you say it is, and maybe more people will believe it really is a crisis.

Bjorn Lomborg,US,"March 30, 2017",NEWS,"USA TODAY (Arlington, VA) ","President Trump's executive order eliminating President Obama's standards for power plants guts the only substantial U.S. measure to reduce harmful carbon emissions, and in doing so reveals the emptiness of the Paris climate treaty.

 is real and mostly caused by humanity. According to the International Energy Agency, the U.S. promised to cut more energy-related CO2 emissions than any country in the world from 2013 to 2025. The problem is that this promise never had much ground in reality.
The primary substantial measure America has ever offered that would achieve the promised cuts was the Clean Power Plan, which required the U.S. power sector to reduce CO2 emissions.
Yet if fully enacted, it would have achieved just a third of the U.S. promises under the Paris Agreement. If it had remained in effect for the entire century, my peer-reviewed research using United Nations  models found that it would have reduced temperature rises by a trivial 0.023 Fahrenheit.
wasted decades
Without the Clean Power Plan, U.S. emissions will likely increase slightly. Yet despite eliminating the actual policy that it relied on to achieve its promises, America will remain party to the Paris treaty, which has been sold to the world as the ultimate deal to fix .
This absurd situation shows that the treaty is nothing but a paper tiger: Its only legal underpinning is that all nations submitted promises -- but those promises do not need to be kept.
Even if every nation fulfilled everything promised, it would get us nowhere near achieving the treaty's unrealistic goal to keep temperature rises under 1.5 degrees Celsius. The U.N. itself has estimated that even if every country lived up to every single promised carbon cut between 2016 and 2030, emissions would be cut by just one-hundredth of what is needed to keep temperature rises below 2 C.
Moreover, many poor nations signed the treaty largely because of a promise of $100 billion a year in ""climate aid"" from rich nations, starting from 2020. Over the past five years, rich countries have managed to come up with only a 10th of one year's promise.
It is only a matter of time before taxpayers from wealthy nations balk at the bill waiting for them. That will make many developing countries back out.
This approach rehashes a failed policy that wasted decades: From 1998, the Kyoto Protocol was sold as the solution to , although every honest analysis showed that its impact would be trivial. Yet it kept governments, non-profit organizations and pressure groups focused on living up to the protocol rather than finding solutions.
Unless we change tack, the preoccupation with a similarly toothless Paris treaty will waste decades more.
The underlying problem with the treaty is that today's green solar and wind technology is still very inefficient, requiring hundreds of billions in annual subsidies for trivial carbon cuts. Therefore, trying to cut emissions significantly requires not just buying off poor nations, but also very high costs.
Calculations using the best peer-reviewed economic models show the global price tag of all the Paris promises -- through slower gross domestic product growth from higher energy costs -- would reach $1 trillion to $2 trillion every year from 2030.
And if America had managed to pass carbon-cutting policies to live up to its big promises, analysis shows that it would have reduced U.S. GDP by more than $150 billion each and every year throughout the century.
We need to focus instead on innovating the price of green energy down below fossil fuels. This would be a much more effective response to , and speed up temperature cuts.
empty promises
A panel of Nobel laureates for the project Copenhagen Consensus on Climate found that the best long-term policy should focus on dramatic increases in global energy research and development. A group led by Bill Gates has already stepped up to promise a doubling to $30 billion. Yet our researchers showed that we should be even more ambitious and increase this sixfold, to reach at least $100 billion a year. Trump campaigned on increases in infrastructure spending. Especially given he has proposed cuts to clean energy agencies, it is to be hoped that more money is allocated to energy R&D.
Global warming is a challenge that deserves a response. But chasing a treaty of empty promises is no response at all.

"Doyle Rice, USA TODAY",US,"October 31, 2017",NEWS,"USA TODAY (Arlington, VA) "," is already having an extraordinary impact on human health worldwide -- affecting the spread of infectious diseases, exposing millions to air pollution and heat waves and dramatically reducing labor productivity, according to a report released Monday.
""The human symptoms of  are unequivocal and potentially irreversible,"" the report by the British medical journal The Lancet says, and the situation is so serious that significant gains by modern medicine and technology are being undercut.
""The delayed response to  over the past 25 years has jeopardized human life and livelihoods,"" the report says.
While most previous similar studies have covered the potential impact of  on future public health problems, The Lancet report goes a step further and illustrates how it is no longer a future threat but a current one.
The direct effects of  ""result from rising temperatures and changes in the frequency and strength of storms, floods, droughts and heat waves -- with physical and mental health consequences,"" it says.
For example, from 2000 to 2016, there has been a 46% increase in the number of weather-related disasters, the report notes.
Some of the findings:
Warming is exacerbating the spread of Dengue fever, the world's most rapidly expanding disease. In fact, two types of mosquitoes' ability to spread Dengue globally has increased by 9.4% and 11.1% since the 1950s.
An additional 125 million people around the world were exposed to heat waves each year from 2000 to 2016 (as compared with 1986-2008) and a record 175 million people were exposed to heat waves in 2015.
Rising temperatures have led to a 5.3% fall in labor productivity in the planet's rural areas since 2000, with a dramatic drop of 2% from 2015 to 2016. In 2016, this effectively took more than 920,000 people out of the global workforce.
Global exposure to dangerous levels of air pollution has increased by 11.2% since 1990.

 is also worsening allergies in the United States. For example, Americans faced significantly longer exposure to ragweed pollen in 2016 compared with 1990.","Climate change no longer future threat: Disease, heat hurting us now, study finds"
Bjorn Lomborg,US,"September 22, 2017",NEWS,"USA TODAY (Arlington, VA) ","This is what global warming looks like, opinion pieces quickly declared in Politico and CNN about devastating Hurricane Harvey. A week later, news media and politicians said the same thing about Hurricane Irma.
Jumping the gun on linking disasters to  is dangerous. It points us toward policies that will have little to no impact on future devastation.
The science is clear but also nuanced:  will worsen some extreme weather events, and it will improve others.
An excellent peer-reviewed analysis in the journal Weather, Climate and Society by University of Manchester scientists Vladimir Jankovic and David Schultz cites the work of the Intergovernmental Panel on , the United Nations' global panel of  experts, and finds, ""Not all extreme weather events will change, nor will some of the changes ¡¦ be detectable.""
The researchers conclude, ""The sound bite of ' means more extreme weather' is a massive oversimplification ¡¦ of the science.""
Heat waves will increase, but cold waves will decrease. Because many more people die from excessive cold than excessive heat, it is likely that the amount of deaths will decline.
As for hurricanes such as Harvey and Irma: Before Harvey, the USA just ended a record 12-year absence of strong hurricanes. Hurricanes are not hitting the U.S. more -- over the past 120 years, major hurricane landfalls have declined from 7.5 per decade to five per decade.
Storms are causing more damage, but this is entirely explained by more people with more wealth living closer to coasts.
Today more people live in Florida's Dade and Broward counties alone, than lived in all 109 coastal counties from Texas through Virginia in 1930. With more people living in more expensive homes, there are higher damage costs. But adjusted for population and wealth, hurricane damage from 1900-2016 actually decreased.
The problem with blaming a disaster such as Harvey or Irma on global warming is that this tells us the answer should be a global warming answer: carbon cuts. That won't help.
Research shows that the Kyoto Protocol, the first major global deal to cut carbon and rein in temperatures (and, it would follow, help prevent hurricanes) failed to achieve a thing. The Paris climate treaty is on track to cost the globe about $1 trillion to $2 trillion per year for the rest of the century. That is an infuriatingly bad investment. It is little wonder that a Royal Society report concludes that cutting CO2 has ""extremely limited potential to reduce future losses.""
Effectively tackling hurricane damage in rich countries is almost exclusively about reducing vulnerability, through better zoning (stop building on flood plains and coasts), better building codes, reducing federally subsidized insurance, and allowing for more wetlands to handle flooding. For the world's poor, policies that reduce poverty are the most effective way of building resilience.
This is what responding to hurricanes needs to look like.

FIRST,US,"August 31, 2017",NEWS,"USA TODAY (Arlington, VA) ","Even as floodwaters raged this week in Texas and Louisiana, so did the debate over the possible link between Hurricane Harvey and man-made .
Climate activists pointed to the historic rainfall and epic flooding as exactly the type of extreme event forecast to occur as the globe warms. Skeptics cited a long list of tropical storms that slammed Texas even before the buildup of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.
So who's right?
In some ways, the question is premature, even unseemly, while search and rescue efforts continue. And a definitive answer won't come until scientists conduct post-storm ""attribution"" studies. In all likelihood, though, the conclusion will be that  didn't cause Harvey, but it almost surely made the storm worse.
Harvey produced 40- to 50-inch rainfall totals that left parts of Houston looking like Venice and rivaled snowfall accumulations from blizzards in the Northeast. It was, in fact, the most extreme rainfall event on the continental United States in recorded history.
Such events are consistent with the basic science of : Warmer than normal water temperatures, in places such as the Gulf of Mexico, provide heat energy that fuels the formation and rapid strengthening of tropical storms. Warmer air holds more water vapor, which in turn produces more rainfall. And rising sea levels exacerbate storm surge and inland flooding.
According to the National Climate Assessment, ""Heavy downpours are increasing nationally (in recent decades), with the largest increases in the Midwest and Northeast. Increases in extreme precipitation are projected for all U.S. regions.""
This isn't just happening in North America.
Even as Harvey riveted the nation's attention this week, the death toll topped 1,000 from unusually severe monsoonal rains half a world away in Bangladesh, India and Nepal.
In the coming days and weeks, expect to hear politicians describe Harvey as an ""act of God"" that had little or nothing to do with human-induced . Even if  is real, they'll add, a serious effort to curb greenhouse gas emissions, through a carbon tax or other means, would be too expensive.
On Wednesday, the private company AccuWeather estimated that Harvey could end up costing $190 billion, making it the priciest natural disaster in U.S. history, equal to the combined cost of Hurricanes Katrina and Sandy.
With that kind of price tag atop a torrent of human misery, the question isn't whether the nation can afford to get serious about global warming. We can't afford not to.",Did climate change intensify Harvey?
FRANK JORDANS and DOROTHEE THIESING Associated Press,US,"November 11, 2017","Business, International, News","Associated Press News Service, The ",", Germany (AP) ? A group of U.S. states, cities, businesses and universities said Saturday they are still committed to curbing global warming even as U.S. President Donald Trump's administration is walking away from the Paris climate accord.
But the alliance, which has an economy larger than Japan and Germany combined, says it won't be able to achieve the necessary cut in greenhouse gas emissions without some efforts at the federal level.

""It is important for the world to know, the American government may have pulled out of the Paris agreement, but the American people are committed to its goals, and there is nothing Washington can do to stop us,"" former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg said at a global climate meeting in Bonn, Germany.

Gov. Jerry Brown of California echoed those comments.

""In the United States, we have a federal system, and states have real power as do cities. And when cities and states combine together, and then join with powerful corporations, that's how we get stuff done,"" he said.

His speech was briefly interrupted by anti-coal and anti-fracking protesters, who held up banners and shouted ""We're still in! Trump's still out!""

The group calling itself ""America's Pledge"" said states, cities and private groups have been taking considerable steps to reduce emissions by promoting renewable energy use and climate-friendly transportation systems.

""This is a pledge, and it's a pledge that you can cash, because it's real,"" Brown said. ""We are doing real stuff in California.""

In a report, however, the group said that ""we cannot underscore strongly enough the critical nature of federal engagement to achieve the deep decarbonization goals the U.S. must undertake after 2025.""

Daniel Firger, one of the report's contributors, said it was intended to show that many in the U.S. aren't prepared to wait for Trump to change his mind on  again or wait for the next administration to tackle the issue.

""The good news around Trump's announcement to withdraw is that it has galvanized a groundswell of bottom-up support from all corners of the U.S. economy,"" Firger told The Associated Press.

Cities, regions and businesses in other nations around the world could look to the group for inspiration and support, he said, noting that the lessons learned by local authorities and businesses in the U.S. could be applied elsewhere.

Also Saturday, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said in her weekly podcast that every country needs to pitch in to keep global temperatures from rising.

Merkel also said it's the responsibility of the industrial countries to develop environment-friendly technologies that are future-oriented, but ""don't lead to a loss of jobs.""

""We don't gain anything if steel mills, aluminum plants and copper mills leave our countries and go somewhere else where environmental regulations are less strict ? because then we haven't made any gains for world climate,"" she said.

JILL COLVIN Associated Press,US,"December 19, 2017",Washington,"Associated Press News Service, The "," (AP) ? President Donald Trump removed  from the list of worldwide threats menacing the United States on Monday, a shift that underscores the long-term ramifications of the ""America first"" world view he laid out in his new National Security Strategy.
The document depicts Russia and China as combative rivals in perpetual competition with the U.S. But it makes no mention of what scientists say are the dangers posed by a warming climate, including more extreme weather events that could spark humanitarian crises, mass migrations, and conflict.

It's a significant departure from the Obama administration, which had described  as an ""urgent and growing threat to our national security."" And it demonstrates how Trump, despite struggling to push his own agenda through a Republican-controlled Congress, has been able to unilaterally dismantle one of his predecessor's signature efforts.

As far back as 2003, during George W. Bush's presidency, a report commissioned by the Defense Department said abrupt  threatened ""disruption and conflict,"" refugee crises, border tensions and more military conflicts.

Trump's national security report, required annually by Congress, emphasizes that economic security is national security for the U.S. It makes clear the United States will unilaterally defend its sovereignty, even if that means risking existing agreements with other countries.

The new document doesn't eliminate references to the environment entirely. It ""recognizes the importance of environmental stewardship"" and says that ""climate policies will continue to shape the global energy system.""

""The United States will remain a global leader in reducing traditional pollution, as well as greenhouse gases, while expanding our economy,"" it reads.

But Trump, in a speech about the report, blamed past administrations for putting ""American energy under lock and key"" and said his approach ""embraces a future of American energy dominance and self-sufficiency.""

""Our nation must take advantage of our wealth in domestic resources and energy efficiency to promote competitiveness across our industries,"" he said.

That thinking represents a reversal, not just from previous Democratic administrations, but from Republican as well, said Geoffrey Dabelko, director of environmental studies at Ohio University.

""Proscribing more fossil fuels rather than seeing that as a fundamental source of vulnerability that undercuts resilience ... that is definitely a departure, in some ways turning the argument on its head,"" he said.

The last national strategy document, prepared by President Barack Obama in 2015, identified  as a national security risk alongside threats like the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and catastrophic attacks on the U.S. homeland.

, that document warned, was contributing to ""increased natural disasters, refugee flows and conflicts over basic resources like food and water"" and was already being felt ""from the Arctic to the Midwest,"" with rising sea levels and storm surges threatening coastal regions, infrastructure and property.

Jamil N. Jaffer, founder of the National Security Institute at George Mason University's law school, sees the broader new strategy as a shift ""that reasserts America's role in the world as a nation willing to assert its power and influence in its own interest, and as a nation ready and willing to engage in competition--and win--in areas ranging from economics to diplomacy.""

But Rosina Bierbaum, a University of Michigan environmental policy scientist, said, ""Not including  in a document about security threats is putting our head in the sand.""

 is ""absolutely a security threat,"" posing risks to U.S. coastal infrastructure, expanding the ranges of pests and pathogens, and fueling more powerful storms and wildfires, she said. Around the world, the changing climate threatens food and drinking water shortages that will boost mass migration and heighten international tension, said Bierbaum, a former associate director of the White House Office of Science and Technology during the Clinton administration who helped write the initial congressionally mandated national climate assessment.

Michael Oppenheimer, a climate scientist at Princeton University, said, ""There's a big element of cutting off our nose to spite our face just because the administration doesn't like the words '.'""

Since taking office, Trump has worked to roll back regulations on planet-warming carbon emissions. He announced his intention to withdraw from what he described as ""the very expensive and unfair"" Paris climate agreement signed by nearly 200 nations, approved the Keystone XL pipeline, and worked to scrap Obama-era initiatives meant to reduce carbon emissions from coal-fired power plants, among a long list of measures.

Trump has personally expressed skepticism about the reality of , describing it on Twitter as an ""expensive hoax"" that was ""created by and for the Chinese"" to hurt U.S. manufacturing.

However, members of the Trump administration, including Defense Secretary James Mattis, have made clear they believe a changing climate should be taken into account by the U.S. military.

Trump himself signed a defense spending bill this month that orders the Pentagon to assess the ""vulnerabilities to military installations and combatant commander requirements resulting from  over the next 20 years.""

""Trump is not just ignoring science and public opinion about the dangers of the climate crisis, he's ignoring American generals and the Pentagon about what it takes to keep our military and our country safe,"" Michael Brune, executive director of the Sierra Club, said in a statement.

But David Titley, a retired rear admiral and the director of the Center for Solutions to Weather and Climate Risk at Penn State, said he was pleased to see at least some reference to greenhouse gases and pollution in the document, although he said it was unlikely to have much impact on day-to-day actions by the Department of Defense.

""The facts on the ground are the earth is continuing to heat up. The sea level continues to rise. So whether or not this administration talks about climate risk, the DoD is going to have to deal with it,"" he said.

""The issue for me is I'm a scientist and I live near the ocean. It's absolutely clear to me that  is happening, and it worries me,"" she said. ""I will fight this tooth and nail.""

Lockman wants to prohibit the state attorney general from investigating, joining an investigation or prosecuting any person based on that person's protected political speech.

But he said his bill would also reaffirm free speech by protecting  supporters as well.

""I don't want to see a Republican state attorney general issuing subpoenas for the records of progressive or liberal think tanks or public policy groups to chill their free speech,"" he said.

Democratic Attorney General Janet Mills declined to comment.

In his bill, Lockman says that the Supreme Court's decision in Citizens United ""continued the protection of protected political speech, no matter the source or message."" That case allowed corporations and unions to make unlimited independent expenditures in U.S. elections.

Jonathan Reisman, an associate professor of economics and public policy at the University of Maine at Machias and a vocal critic of the scientific consensus on , said he requested the bill.

He said the bill is an attempt to defend the First Amendment freedom of those who speak out in a way that does not reflect the consensus.

""It's about Citizens United and the government abridging speech,"" he said. ""It's not about climate science. It's about climate policy.""

Lockman has a history of causing controversy. He once dressed as a vampire outside a federal building in Bangor to protest the Internal Revenue Service. He also once accused liberals of assisting the AIDS epidemic, saying they assured ""the public that the practice of sodomy is a legitimate alternative lifestyle, rather than a perverted and depraved crime against humanity.""

He said he couldn't predict the outcome of his latest bill but expected a lot of interest at a public hearing scheduled April 6.

Lockman's bill is ""absurd and unnecessary,"" said Dylan Voorhees, climate and clean energy project director for the Natural Resources Council of Maine.

FRANK JORDANS Associated Press,US,"March 28, 2017",International,"Associated Press News Service, The "," (AP) ? Scientists, officials and environmental campaigners in Europe said Tuesday that the United States would be damaging its own interests if it rolls back the previous administration's efforts to curb .
U.S. President Donald Trump is expected to sign an executive order Tuesday that would rescind, suspend or review Obama-era regulations, including those restricting greenhouse gas emissions at coal-fired power plants.

The regulations are a key part of America's contribution toward meeting global goals agreed at an international  summit in Paris two years ago.

Thomas Stocker, a climate scientist at the University of Bern, Switzerland, said Trump's plan to halt decommissioning of old and polluting coal-fired power stations would hurt the United States in the long run.

""If 'America First' means you want to lead, then you can't turn the clock back and rely on a century-old technology. You're missing the train,"" he said.

Stocker, a former co-chair of the U.N.'s scientific panel on , noted that the Obama administration had been a driving force behind securing the Paris agreement in 2015.

""They are giving up that leadership position and I suspect that it will be taken up by other competitive countries,"" said Stocker, adding that China was well-placed to do so.

That view was echoed by Myles R. Allen, a climate scientist at the University of Oxford. ""If China saw the U.S. as being short-sighted (...) they might even welcome this as a chance to take over climate leadership,"" he said.

Allen, who co-authored a recent report for the U.S. National Academies of Sciences on measuring how much greenhouse gas emissions cost society, said Trump's plan could undermine a crucial mechanism by which the United States government wanted to mitigate global warming.

Under U.S. regulations, authorities calculate the ""social cost"" of carbon emissions in order to compare it to the cost of complying with regulations aimed at curbing greenhouse gas emissions.

Drastically reducing the estimated social cost of carbon, as the Trump administration has indicated, would increase profits from burning oil, coal and gas in the United States.

Allen said that could send a signal to developing countries, such as Indonesia and Bangladesh, that fossil fuels are a viable source of energy in the coming decades.

""It will definitely chuck sand in the wheels of efforts to control global ,"" he said.

Germany, which plans to get most of its energy from renewable sources by 2050, said ambitious policies on  are in the United States' very own interests.

Germany's environment minister, Barbara Hendricks, said promoting renewable energy and energy efficiency is already creating large numbers of jobs around the world. ""Whoever tries to change into reverse gear is only going to harm themselves when it comes to international competitiveness,"" she said.

Sweelin Heuss, the chief executive of Greenpeace Germany, said Trump's plan is ""bad news, but it's not the end of the Paris agreement.""

She urged German Chancellor Angela Merkel to speak out against the plan and emphasize Europe's commitment to combating .

MELANIE PLENDA Associated Press,US,"February 21, 2017",Domestic,"Associated Press News Service, The ",", N.H. (AP) ? New Hampshire's maple syrup producers say they are feeling the impact of , as winters become warmer and frigid nights so critical to their business become fewer.
Producers joined climate experts and Democratic U.S. Sen. Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire on Tuesday to talk about the state's changing climate and how it is affecting one of the state's most important industries.

Some producers talked of seeing a steep drop in the amounts of sap they are getting, while others are dealing with another trend attributed to warmer temperatures in which the sap goes up to the top of the trees rather than down to taps. Others complained about a drop in the sugar content of their sap.

""When I purchased the farm in 2000, ""I was getting 75 gallons of sap,"" said Ray LaRoche of LaRoche Farm in Durham. ""With the environmental changes we've been seeing, it's down to 15 gallons. That's a dramatic loss for us. And I don't know what to do about it.""

Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York, Pennsylvania and Vermont produced 3.78 million gallons of syrup in 2016, according to a Northeast maple syrup production statistics service run by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Vermont is the clear leader, alone producing more than 47 percent of the country's maple syrup.

Hassan said the state's changing climate can have dramatic effects on the natural resources that ""define us as a state and are critical to our economy, our environment, and our way of life in New Hampshire.""

""Unfortunately, we are already seeing the real impacts of  on our economy ? including on our maple syrup and ski industries,"" she said, referring to warmer winters and a decline in snow cover.

The ideal temperatures for sap production are in the 20s at night and 30s and 40s during the day. When the climate is in the 50s and 60s during the day and the nights stay warm, sap runs not to the taps, but to the tops of the trees, causing the tree to bloom. That can lead to a cloudy and off-tasting product.

""The other day we had a nice 50-degree day which is kind of the new normal but still not normal,"" said Jeff Moore of Windswept farm. ""One of the challenges we've had to start weighing is when do we actually tap because putting a tap into a tree is a wound, the trees naturally act to try to compartmentalize that wound and wall it off.""

The longer the tap has been exposed to the environment, the sooner the tree is going to wall it off, Moore said.

""When I was growing up,"" he added, ""you didn't want to tap too early, because if you tapped too early you'd miss all of the good weather at the end of the season, when most of your sap is running. So that gets a little more challenging now.""

But despite the challenges, some producers and experts at the University of New Hampshire say technological fixes are helping the industry adapt ? and even extend the season.

Perry's view is contrary to mainstream climate science, including analyses by NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

Taking down the web page came after EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt, appearing on ""Squawk Box"" in March, said ""there's tremendous disagreement about the degree of impact"" of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases on the planet.

""So, no, I would not agree that (carbon dioxide) is a primary contributor to the global warming that we see,"" Pruitt said.

The Nobel Prize-winning Intergovernmental Panel on , organized by the United Nations, calls carbon dioxide the biggest heat trapping force, responsible for about 33 times more added warming than natural causes.

The panel's calculations mean carbon dioxide alone accounts for between 1 and 3 degrees warming, said MIT atmospheric scientist Kerry Emanuel.

Perry, like Pruitt, rejected the scientific consensus on .

""This idea that science is just absolutely settled and if you don't believe it's settled then you're somehow another Neanderthal, that is so inappropriate from my perspective,"" he said.

Being a skeptic about  issues is ""quite all right,"" Perry added, saying skepticism is a sign of being a ""wise, intellectually engaged person.""

Recently, The Associated Press sent Pruitt's comments to numerous scientists who study climate. All seven climate scientists who responded said Pruitt was wrong and that carbon dioxide is the primary driver of global warming.

Perry, in his TV appearance Monday, said there should not be a debate about whether the climate is changing or if humans have an effect on the climate. Instead, he said the debate should be on ""what are the policy changes that we need to make to affect that?""

Shaye Wolf, climate science director at the Center for Biological Diversity, said Perry ""has the science exactly backward.""

Far from being a key cause of , ""the world's oceans are actually another victim of greenhouse pollution,"" Wolf said. ""Our oceans absorb millions of tons of carbon dioxide a day, making them dangerously acidic.""

Warming oceans also put ""tremendous stress on marine life,"" Wolf said.

NASA and NOAA reported in January that earth's 2016 temperatures were the warmest ever. The planet's average surface temperature has risen about 2 degrees Fahrenheit since the late 19th century, ""a change driven largely by increased carbon dioxide and other human-made emissions into the atmosphere,"" the agencies said in a joint statement.

Earlier this month, Trump announced he will withdraw the United States from the Paris climate accord. The agreement signed by 195 nations in 2015 aims to decrease global carbon emissions in an effort to head off the worst predicted effects of global warming, including worsening storms, catastrophic droughts and city-drowning sea level rise.

The Trump administration has also moved to roll back or delay numerous rules approved by the Obama administration to cut pollution from mining operations, oil and gas wells and coal-fired power plants.

The landmark change would, for the first time, put  on an equal footing with other complex challenges affecting the public finances such as demography.

Under a Labour government, the Office for Budget Responsibility would be given total independence, McDonnell will announce, saying the forecaster would report directly to parliament rather than the Treasury.

Speaking at the Institute for Public Policy Research on Tuesday, McDonnell will say that meeting the challenges of  will require ¡°a transformation of our institutions and how our economies are run¡±.

McDonnell said that Labour ¡°wants to ensure that the overwhelming challenge of  is addressed from the very centre of government. This includes the potential losses to the public finances.

¡°The public deserve to know what impacts we might expect on the national purse from the degradation of our environment. Sound, responsible economic management should already be accounting for this.¡±

McDonnell will argue that the effects of manmade  are already having an economic effect. Costs in recent years have included more frequent flooding, which the Environment Agency estimates now costs ?2.2bn annually.

Under Labour, the OBR would be given additional resources to deliver the best economic modelling of environmental impact, McDonnell will say. ¡°It will become a new centre of expertise for environmental macroeconomics,¡± he will say.

The shadow chancellor said he would ¡°guarantee and reinforce that independence of the OBR by making the body report to parliament rather than the Treasury.

¡°We want the public, whether businesses or voters, to be absolutely confident that the public finances are properly scrutinised and managed.¡±

Environmentalists welcomed the proposal though cautioned that the effects of  could not all be given economic value.

Greenpeace UK¡¯s chief scientist, Dr Doug Parr, said the change would ¡°help concentrate the minds of future governments on the urgency and scale of the challenge¡± of  on the economy.

¡°Major companies and financial institutions have already started factoring in the impacts of  in their forecasts, so it¡¯s right that the UK government should do the same for the public purse,¡± he said.

Michael Jacobs, director of the IPPR commission on economic justice, said the change would be an important shift. ¡°Over the last few years the Bank of England has been telling the financial sector that it must report on the investment risks arising from ,¡± he said.

Ian Sample Science editor,UK,"January 16, 2017",Science,"Guardian, The (London, England) ","Leading scientists have asked the prime minister to urge president-elect Donald Trump to acknowledge the risks of  and declare his support for international efforts to combat global warming.
One hundred researchers, including many of the most prominent climate scientists in Britain, have written to Theresa May to warn her of the potential threats posed by Donald Trump, who has made clear he does not accept the scientific consensus on warming driven by human activities.

The letter warns that Trump¡¯s administration may severely weaken  research and the collection of data such as Earth temperature records, which are used by scientists and policymakers in the UK and around the world. If the world class climate science now performed in the US is wound down under Trump, the UK must be ready to respond decisively, the letter states. One response would be to rapidly expand British climate science by offering jobs to disaffected US researchers.

Trump has called global warming a hoax and may scrap Nasa¡¯s invaluable climate research program. He threatened to withdraw from the Paris agreement, which aims to avoid the most dire consequences of , though recently he said he had an open mind on US involvement in the plan. He appointed Scott Pruitt, a climate sceptic, to run the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and Rex Tillerson, the CEO of Exxon, to be secretary of state.

¡°We don¡¯t know how bad it will be, and it seems that Trump has slightly gone back on some of the rhetoric, but there are still worrying concerns,¡± said Prof Piers Forster, a signatory of the letter and director of the Priestley International Centre for Climate at Leeds University. ¡°What concerns me is that if we don¡¯t have good scientific data and observations coming from America, we¡¯ll be flying blind.¡±

The letter urges the PM to press Donald Trump directly and through international forums such as the G7 and G20 to accept the reality of  and restate a commitment to the Paris agreement. In rejecting the scientific evidence around , Trump is disregarding the findings and advice from expert bodies around the world, including the US National Academy of Sciences and the Intergovernmental Panel on  (IPCC), the letter states. It adds that the UK science community stands ready to back US researchers in ¡°resisting any political attempts to prevent, hamper, or interfere with vital research on .¡±

The scientists behind the letter, which was sent on Friday, want any weakening in US  to be met by an expansion of research in Britain. That could see the UK substantially bolster its expertise in the area by offering jobs to top US researchers whose work is shut down, or who simply become disillusioned under the Trump administration.

¡°There are opportunities for UK universities to make some fantastic appointments. I¡¯m the director of a brand new institute and we are interested in giving these people jobs,¡± Forster said. Other signatories to the letter include Prof Phil Jones, director of the Climatic Research Unit at the University of East Anglia, Prof Corinne Le Qu?r?, director of the Tyndall Centre for  Research, and Prof Jim Hall, director of the Environmental Change Institute at Oxford University.

¡°We have to be prepared as a country because things could change quite rapidly,¡± Forster said. ¡°If climate scientists in the US start to lose their jobs, we have to be ready to take up the slack.¡±

The last Republican president, George W Bush, was roundly criticised by climate scientists for interfering with research and public messages around global warming research. During his administration, a report from the EPA was edited by White House officials to reduce a long section on the risks of rising temperatures to a handful of vague paragraphs. In one email exchange that came to light, White House officials sought help from the conservative lobby group, the Competitive Enterprise Institute, which received more than $1m (?820,000) in donations from Exxon, to play down a report in which the US admitted for the first time that humans contributed to global warming.

Within days of President Bush¡¯s inauguration, Randy Randol, an ExxonMobil lobbyist, sent a memo to the White House asking if Bob Watson, the former head of the World Bank¡¯s environment department and then-chair of the IPCC, could be replaced at the request of the US. Watson, who was knighted in 2012 and had long warned about the impact of burning fossil fuels and the need to change to prevent environmental harm, was duly unseated and replaced.

The foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, has told MPs that the UK will stress the importance of  to the Americans, but there is an acceptance among ministers that US climate policy is a matter for the US to decide.

A government spokesperson said the UK¡¯s commitment to tackling  was ¡°as strong as ever and we are clear that there will be no attempts to go back on what was agreed during negotiations in Paris and Marrakesh.¡± Theresa May closed the government¡¯s dedicated  department last year. Work in the area now falls to the new Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy.

¡°We know the UK and US face very similar energy challenges. We¡¯ve had great experience working together on all kinds of energy and  issues and look forward to this collaboration continuing,¡± the spokesperson added.","Leading scientists urge May to pressure Trump over climate change - Scientists worry that Trump, who has called climate change a ¡®hoax¡¯, will not commit the US to the Paris agreement"
Damian Carrington and Jelmer Mommers,UK,"February 28, 2017",Environment,"Guardian, The (London, England) ","The oil giant Shell issued a stark warning of the catastrophic risks of  more than a quarter of century ago in a prescient 1991 film that has been rediscovered.
However, since then the company has invested heavily in highly polluting oil reserves and helped lobby against climate action, leading to accusations that Shell knew the grave risks of global warming but did not act accordingly.

Shell¡¯s 28-minute film, called Climate of Concern, was made for public viewing, particularly in schools and universities. It warned of extreme weather, floods, famines and climate refugees as fossil fuel burning warmed the world. The serious warning was ¡°endorsed by a uniquely broad consensus of scientists in their report to the United Nations at the end of 1990¡±, the film noted.

¡°If the weather machine were to be wound up to such new levels of energy, no country would remain unaffected,¡± it says. ¡°Global warming is not yet certain, but many think that to wait for final proof would be irresponsible. Action now is seen as the only safe insurance.¡±

Related:  Shell's 1991 warning: climate changing ¡®at faster rate than at any time since end of ice age¡¯

A separate 1986 report, marked ¡°confidential¡± and also seen by the Guardian, notes the large uncertainties in climate science at the time but nonetheless states: ¡°The changes may be the greatest in recorded history.¡±

The predictions in the 1991 film for temperature and sea level rises and their impacts were remarkably accurate, according to scientists, and Shell was one of the first major oil companies to accept the reality and dangers of .

But, despite this early and clear-eyed view of the risks of global warming, Shell invested many billions of dollars in highly polluting tar sand operations and on exploration in the Arctic. It also cited fracking as a ¡°future opportunity¡± in 2016, despite its own 1998 data showing exploitation of unconventional oil and gas was incompatible with climate goals.

The film was obtained by the Correspondent, a Dutch online journalism platform, and shared with the Guardian, and lauds commercial-scale solar and wind power that already existed in 1991. Shell has recently lobbied successfully to undermine European renewable energy targets and is estimated to have spent $22m in 2015 lobbying against climate policies. The company¡¯s investments in low-carbon energy have been minimal compared to its fossil fuel investments.

Shell has also been a member of industry lobby groups that have fought climate action, including the so-called Global Climate Coalition until 1998; the far-right American Legislative Exchange Council (Alec) until 2015; and remains a member of the Business Roundtable and the American Petroleum Institute today.

Another oil giant, Exxon Mobil, is under investigation by the US Securities and Exchange Commission and state attorney generals for allegedly misleading investors about the risks  posed to its business. The company said they are confident they are compliant. In early 2016, a group of congressmen asked the Department of Justice to also ¡°investigate whether Shell¡¯s actions around  violated federal law¡±.

¡°They knew. Shell told the public the truth about  in 1991 and they clearly never got round to telling their own board of directors,¡± said Tom Burke at the green thinktank E3G, who was a member of Shell¡¯s external review committee from 2012-14 and has also advised BP and the mining giant Rio Tinto. ¡°Shell¡¯s behaviour now is risky for the climate but it is also risky for their shareholders. It is very difficult to explain why they are continuing to explore and develop high-cost reserves.¡±

Bill McKibben, a leading US environmentalist, said: ¡°The fact that Shell understood all this in 1991, and that a quarter-century later it was trying to open up the Arctic to oil-drilling, tells you all you¡¯ll ever need to know about the corporate ethic of the fossil fuel industry. Shell made a big difference in the world ? a difference for the worse.¡±

Prof Tom Wigley, the climate scientist who was head of the Climate Research Unit at the University of East Anglia when it helped Shell with the 1991 film, said: ¡°It¡¯s one of the best little films that I have seen on  ever. One could show this today and almost all would still be relevant.¡± He said Shell¡¯s actions since 1991 had ¡°absolutely not¡± been consistent with the film¡¯s warning.

A Shell spokeswoman said: ¡°Our position on  is well known; recognising the climate challenge and the role energy has in enabling a decent quality of life. Shell continues to call for effective policy to support lower carbon business and consumer choices and opportunities such as government lead carbon pricing/trading schemes.

¡°Today, Shell applies a $40 per tonne of CO2 internal project screening value to project decision-making and has developed leadership positions in natural gas and sugarcane ethanol; the lowest carbon hydrocarbon and biofuel respectively,¡± she said.

Instead, Trump¡¯s NSS paper emphasised the need for the US to regain its economic competitiveness in the world.

That stance represents a sharp change from the Obama administration¡¯s NSS, which placed  as one of the main dangers facing the nation and made building international consensus on containing global warming a national security priority.

White House officials said on Sunday that the Trump NSS was the culmination of 11 months of collaboration between all the leading security, foreign policy and economic agencies of government. The exclusion of  as a national security threat appears however to conflict with views previously expressed by the defense secretary, James Mattis.

¡° is not identified as a national security threat but climate and the importance of the environment and environmental stewardship are discussed,¡± a senior administration official said.

Another official said Trump¡¯s remarks when he announced he was taking the US out of the Paris climate accord ¡°would be the guidepost for the language in the NSS on climate¡±.

In that speech in June, Trump declared ¡°I was elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris¡± and alleged the agreement ¡°hamstrings the United States while empowering some of the world¡¯s top polluting countries¡±.

The Federalist website, which first reported that Trump would drop  from the NSS, quoted the draft document as suggesting the Trump administration would actively oppose efforts to reduce the burning of oil, gas and coal for energy.

¡°US leadership is indispensable to countering an anti-growth energy agenda that is detrimental to US economic and energy security interests,¡± the website quoted the document as saying.

¡°Given future global energy demand, much of the developing world will require fossil fuels, as well as other forms of energy, to power their economies and lift their people out of poverty.¡±

A senior official said on Sunday the main difference between the Trump NSS and its predecessors was a new emphasis on border security and economic issues.

¡°The economic piece ¡¦ gets much more attention,¡± the official said. ¡°The insistence that economic security is national security.¡±

In unpublished testimony provided to Congress after his confirmation hearings in January, Mattis said the US military had to consider how the thawing Arctic and drought in global flashpoints would pose present and future challenges.

Anna Fazackerley,UK,"March 14, 2017",Education,"Guardian, The (London, England) ","UK scientists are warning they may be unable to carry out crucial research on  if Donald Trump cuts climate science funding in the US.
Trump tweeted in 2014 that research on global warming is ¡°very expensive bullshit¡± that ¡°has to stop¡±. Scientists are braced to find out whether his administration will put these words into practice. The early signs are not good. Last month Scott Pruitt, one of the US Environmental Protection Agency¡¯s fiercest critics, was named as its new head. There are rumours that the budget of its office for research could be cut by more than 40% as part of extensive overall cuts.

Meanwhile there are reports that the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), one of America¡¯s leading climate science agencies, could have its budget cut by nearly 20%. The agency¡¯s satellite division, a vital source of data for climate research, is expected to bear the brunt of cuts.

Related:  EPA head Scott Pruitt denies that carbon dioxide causes global warming

British scientists say moves to squeeze funding of climate-related research in the US ? and of facilities at government laboratories in particular ? could be disastrous for work in the UK. And they say Trump¡¯s travel ban is already harming their collaboration with scientists in America, with some researchers pulling out of commitments in the UK because of fears they may not make it back through US visa controls.

Prof Joanna Haigh, co-director of the Grantham Institute at Imperial College London, says: ¡°Everything we do is international, and we particularly rely on American satellite data. Perhaps we could manage if other areas were cut ? perhaps the Chinese or the Indians might even step in to fill the gaps ? but we would definitely miss the satellite data from the US.¡±

Haigh uses satellite data to study how the sun influences the Earth¡¯s climate. She is helping to disentangle the effect of natural fluctuations in solar energy from those of manmade greenhouse gases ? and she is clear that global warming cannot be attributed to the sun or other natural processes.

¡°At Imperial we use NOAA satellite data for many important climate studies. For example, it can tell us how much of the sun¡¯s energy the Earth absorbs, how much heat energy it emits and how these values depend on other factors, particularly cloud cover.¡±

She says cutting the NOAA¡¯s budget would be a ¡°huge hit¡± not only for science, but also for our understanding of the weather. ¡°They are trying to get rid of everything that could be badged as . But to understand the climate you need to measure the weather. You can¡¯t separate the two. Whether you are on a  ¡®bandwagon¡¯ is irrelevant.¡±

Prof Piers Forster, director of the Priestley International Centre for Climate at Leeds University, says: ¡°If organisations like Nasa and the NOAA are prohibited from putting up new satellites, that could be really detrimental for the entire international science community. We urgently need these data sets to be able to monitor and understand .¡±

Like many scientists Forster fears a cull across a number of US government laboratories concerned with . ¡°Our one biggest concern is the loss of raw talent,¡± he says. ¡°The loss of people we collaborate with and the people producing this data that we rely on.¡±

He says the Trump administration is already making scientific collaboration across the Atlantic more difficult. ¡°Quite a lot of the academics we work with in America are immigrants and some of them are concerned about leaving the country in case they don¡¯t get back in. We¡¯ve certainly seen instances where people have pulled out of coming to scientific conferences. Four or five people I know of, speakers and so forth, have pulled out of their commitments to come here.¡±

In a recent example a key scientist from Princeton University pulled out of a  workshop that Forster co-organised at Imperial College London.

American research fellow Dr Sarah Batterman moved to Leeds University to work on tropical forests and  a year ago after doing postdoctoral research at Princeton. She is in regular contact with colleagues in the US and says: ¡°The situation for people doing climate-related science in the US is really scary. There is so much uncertainty. I think people are trying to keep their heads down and keep their research going as much as they can until they see what is going to happen.¡±

Batterman works closely with scientists at the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute, a US government laboratory in Panama, and is concerned about whether its funding will continue. ¡°My research wouldn¡¯t be possible without the Smithsonian facilities. So for me this isn¡¯t just something that is happening at a distance,¡± she explains.

For Prof Rosalind Cornforth, director of the Walker Institute at Reading University, the anxiety about the US pulling the plug on climate science is somewhat different. Her institute works with governments and scientists in some of the world¡¯s most fragile, conflict-affected countries, applying climate science to solve real-world problems.

¡°So many of our fellow climate scientists from developing countries rely on access to climate data sets available in the US,¡± she says. ¡°If these become restricted in the future, there would be repercussions on vital capacity development for places like Africa.¡±

There is one potential silver lining for UK universities in this cloud of uncertainty. Vice-chancellors at some leading universities said last week they hoped to be able to woo some big-name climate scientists from across the Atlantic.

Forster, whose institute is only a year old and is recruiting staff, says: ¡°I have just got back from a trip to America to talk to people. Many scientists think it is too early to leave. They don¡¯t know quite what Trump will do, and there is even some optimism that perhaps he won¡¯t survive a four-year term. But they are definitely interested in talking to us about possibilities.¡±

Prof Paul Ekins, director of University College London¡¯s Institute for Sustainable Resources, says many climate scientists may feel forced to leave the US if conditions worsen. ¡°If you are in a science field that depends on expensive equipment, like climate science research from space, and you can¡¯t get that kit because the funding dries up, you can¡¯t do anything. This is applied, practical work trying to understand what is happening to the climate. US scientists may well hope that things will change with the future administration, but they may not want to write off four to eight years of their productive lives.¡±

However, some climate scientists point out that with Brexit looming Britain may struggle to present itself as a place of calm and stability from which to escape Trump. Batterman says: ¡°I think early career researchers who are looking for jobs may be considering options abroad. But there is also a lot of uncertainty in the UK too, because we don¡¯t know what is going to happen with funding after the UK leaves the EU.¡±",British scientists face a ¡®huge hit¡¯ if the US cuts climate change research - Academics fear Donald Trump¡¯s environmental policy may put an end to key data from US agencies

It comes at a time when Conservative MPs are being asked by party officials to show off their green credentials after internal polling showed the level of concern among younger voters about environmental issues.

The party has been alarmed by the backlash against May¡¯s support for a free vote on foxhunting, the omission of a ban on the ivory trade from the manifesto and its lack of support for an amendment that would have recognised in UK law that animals feel pain. They have since backtracked on all three issues.

The environment secretary, Michael Gove, will publish a draft bill on Tuesday that explicitly enshrines animal sentience in domestic law. It will also increase the maximum prison sentence in England and Wales for animal cruelty from six months to five years.

¡°Animals are sentient beings who feel pain and suffering, so we are writing that principle into law and ensuring that we protect their welfare,¡± Gove said. ¡°We are a nation of animal lovers so we will make Brexit work not just for citizens but for the animals we love and cherish too.¡±

Gove is also said to be pressing for more of the UK¡¯s overseas aid budget to be spent on cutting plastic pollution after it emerged that 90% of the waste in the ocean came from 10 rivers in Africa and Asia, according to a report in the Times.

The Guardian revealed this month that Conservative MPs had been hauled in by No 10 to be briefed on seven new policy principles underpinned by a focus on the environment in an attempt to turn the situation around.

As the final episode of the BBC¡¯s Blue Planet II finished on Sunday evening, many Tory MPs published messages on Twitter to push the government¡¯s environmental policies, accompanied by Conservative-branded graphics.

The change in strategy comes a decade after Cameron tried to make the party focus on green issues, changing the Conservative logo to a tree, installing a wind turbine on his roof and visiting the Arctic to learn about global warming ? where he was mocked for metaphorically trying to ¡°hug a husky¡±.

However, he moved away from this agenda over the course of his premiership and reportedly ordered officials to ¡°cut the green crap¡± from energy bills and ban the expansion of onshore windfarms as he came under pressure from rightwingers in the party.

The research found that birds that prefer cooler climes, such as meadow pipits, willow tits and willow warblers, have disappeared from sites in south-east England and East Anglia, where intensive crop growing is common.

¡°Birds are facing a double-edged sword from  and declines in habitat quality,¡± said Tom Oliver, at the University of Reading, who led the new study. ¡°In England, birds really look like they are struggling to cope with . They are already being hit with long-term reductions in habitat quality and, for the cold-associated birds, those losses are being further exacerbated by .¡±

¡° is with us, here and now, and its effects on wildlife are increasingly well documented,¡± said Mike Morecroft, principal  specialist at Natural England, and part of the research team.

Simon Gillings, at the British Trust for Ornithology, and another member of the research team, said: ¡°Intensive [land] management is making it harder for cold-associated birds to find cool corners of sites, or to disperse away from warming regions.¡±

But Oliver noted that showing the impact of  on wildlife is affected by the availability of good habitats means action can be taken: ¡°We are not completely at the mercy of .¡± Creating larger natural areas in strategic places will help species cope with a changing climate, the scientists said.

The study, published in Global Change Biology, analysed both bird and butterfly data from more than 600 sites monitored between 1964 and 2009. It found butterflies were adapting much better to  than birds, although cold-associated butterfly species also suffered if the area around the site was poor in natural habitat.

But while many of the butterfly species that enjoy warmer weather were thriving, birds associated with warmer temperatures were not, due to lost or degraded habitat.

Oliver said butterflies were faring better as they require much smaller areas of natural land, which are more likely to be available. Good habitat means more suitable food plants and more microclimates in which species can thrive in good years and survive in poor ones.

The ringlet butterfly, for example, suffers badly in drought years. But they can hang on if there are patches of broadleaf woodland available, as these resist droughts and keep soils more moist than treeless landscapes.

Butterflies can also produce many generations in a single year when conditions are favourable, whereas birds reproduce more slowly. The small copper butterfly can have up to five generations a year, Oliver said.

Like butterflies, dragonflies and damselflies are generally adapting well to  and warming has brought 11 new species to Britain since 1995, according to a new report from the British Dragonfly Society. Newcomers include the stunning large white-faced darter and Genevieve Dalley, at the BDS, said: ¡°These unprecedented events currently happening in the dragonfly world are exciting but also act as a warning: the natural world is changing.¡±

But global warming is also threatening the northern damselfly, restricted to a few small lochs in Scotland, and the black darter, which is becoming less common in the south of Britain.

The scientists conducting the bird and butterfly research determined the temperature favoured by each species by looking at the average warmth of their ranges across Europe, with those preferring heat found mostly in southern Europe and vice versa.

Stopping the destruction of habitat such as hedgerows and old orchards and creating new nature reserves can give opportunities for wildlife to adapt to global warming said Oliver. But biodiversity across England continues to fall, he said, despite a landmark review of wildlife sites for the government in 2010.

¡°That report called for a step change in nature conservation,¡± said Oliver. ¡°We are still waiting for that step change and until we see it we can¡¯t really expect the fortunes of our wildlife to change.¡±

Richard Bradbury at the RSPB and not involved in the new research said: ¡°Making use of the tremendously rich wildlife data collected by dedicated UK volunteer observers, this study provides further compelling evidence that  is already affecting the UK¡¯s species.¡±

Jillian Ambrose,UK,"August 24, 2017",Business,"Daily Telegraph, The/The Sunday Telegraph (London, England) (Published as Daily Telegraph, The (London, England))  ","THE fierce backlash against ExxonMobil's climate claims has reached new heights after a damning report alleged the company misled the public over the risk of man-made  for decades.
ExxonMobil is already facing a looming legal threat from US states and a group of shareholders over allegations that it has cast doubt on the existence of man-made  since the 1980s, despite clear evidence from its own researchers that global warming fears are valid.

Research scientists at Harvard University, who scrutinised 187 ExxonMobil  documents, said the company chose to doubt the reality of the problem in public, while it knew it was real.

ExxonMobil, like many oil companies, has employed scientists to study climate concerns. For the past 40 years the company has found that the majority of its research supports the theory that man-made carbon emissions are responsible for potentially devastating changes to the world's climate.

Harvard's empirical analysis found that between 1983 and the present, 83pc of ExxonMobil's peer-reviewed research papers and 80pc of its internal documents acknowledged that  was real and man-made. By contrast only 12pc of its paid-for editorial-style advertisements published in the New York Times side with this consensus, with 81pc instead expressing doubt over the reality of .

The scientists concluded that Exxon-Mobil did ""mislead"" the public, throwing fuel on the smouldering legal threat against the company which is being compared to the tidal wave of litigation against Big Tobacco in the wake of proof of the dangers of smoking.

Eric Schneiderman, the New York attorney general, has issued multiple subpoenas to ExxonMobil and, together with the attorney generals of 17 US states and territories, is investigating whether or not the firm has violated statutes relating to racketeering, consumer protection or investor protection.

""The attorney general's investigation of ExxonMobil has uncovered significant evidence indicating that Exxon may have misled New York investors and consumers about the risk of  to the company,"" said a spokeswoman for Mr Schneiderman.

""We will continue to vigorously pursue our investigation, regardless of Exxon's unprecedented campaign of delay and distraction.""

ExxonMobil, which raked in earnings of $3.4bn (?2.6bn) in the second quarter, has consistently rebuffed the claims. ""We unequivocally reject allegations that ExxonMobil suppressed  research contained in media reports that are inaccurate distortions of ExxonMobil's nearly 40-year history of climate research,"" the company has said previously.

But the Harvard scientists argue that although Exxon's research was publicly available via the company's website, its communications with the public cast doubt on climate science and were at odds with the majority of the internal research.

The rest of the G7 group of rich nations, including Britain, spent three days urging Mr Trump to stick with the accord, first in meetings in Brussels and then at a two-day summit in the clifftop town of Taormina in Sicily.

Mr Trump, who has previously described man-made  as ""a hoax"", wrote on Twitter yesterday: ""I will make my final decision on the Paris Accord next week!"", pre-empting the final communique issued by the G7 leaders at the end of the summit.

Before leaving Sicily, Mr Trump told US service families he thought he had ""hit a home run"" everywhere he had visited during his nine-day tour.

Mr Trump also said his appeals to Nato allies to pay more was working. ""Money is starting to flow in,"" he said.

""It's only fair to the United States. We're behind Nato all the way. But we want to be treated fairly.""

Gary Cohn, his chief economic adviser, said Mr Trump needed more time to weigh up the pros and cons of the  pact.

""There was a very frank exchange of views but he's not made a final decision on Paris,"" Mr Cohn said.

""He continues to study the issue. We had a very robust conversation.""

The White House characterised the President's discussion on  with the leaders of Britain, Canada, Italy, Germany, France and Japan as ""very constructive and warm"", but Angela Merkel, by contrast, called them a struggle.

""The entire discussion about climate was very difficult, if not to say very unsatisfactory,"" the German chancellor said. ""We have a situation of six against one.

""There are no indications whether the United States will stay in the Paris Agreement or not.""

The rest of the G7, as well as the heads of the European Commission and the European Council, pledged in the summit declaration to ""reaffirm their strong commitment to swiftly implement the Paris Agreement,"" leaving the US isolated.

""The United States of America is in the process of reviewing its policies on  and on the Paris Agreement and thus is not in a position to join the consensus on these topics,"" the summit statement said.

Jennifer Morgan, executive director of Greenpeace International, said: ""Europe, Canada and Japan stood up today and made a stand, revealing again how far Trump is out of step with the rest of the world on .""

While there was a standoff on , there was some compromise on global trade. The final declaration said the G7 leaders were committed ""to keep our markets open and to fight protectionism, while standing firm against all unfair trade practices"".

The final statement also recognised ""the importance of the rules-based international trading system"".

While on the campaign trail last year, Mr Trump threatened to impose unilateral tariffs on Mexican and Chinese goods and said he would pull his country out of the North American Free Trade Agreement unless it was renegotiated.

Last week he called Germany ""very bad"" on trade because its car exports had created a surplus with the United States.

The G7 leaders were heavily criticised for failing to tackle the migration crisis, the chaos in Libya and looming famines in Somalia, South Sudan, Nigeria and Yemen, where 20million people are in danger of starvation as a result of conflicts and drought.

""It's a big failure of leadership and a failure to protect vulnerable people who are suffering from drought, famine and conflic,"" said Chris Derksen Hiebert, director of policy for World Vision International.

Gordon Rayner CHIEF REPORTER,UK,"January 20, 2017",News,"Daily Telegraph, The/The Sunday Telegraph (London, England) (Published as Daily Telegraph, The (London, England))  ","THE Prince of Wales has described  as the ""wolf at the door"" as he urged world leaders to take immediate steps to combat what he sees as the biggest threat to the planet's future.
In his bleakest comments on the subject to date, the Prince says action on  ""must be urgently scaled up, and scaled up now"".

The Prince's warning, which will be interpreted as a direct message to Theresa May and Donald Trump among others, is contained in the foreword to a new Ladybird book he has co-authored, called , which is published next week.

Intriguingly, Mr Trump has said he plans to meet the Prince ""in the coming weeks"", which would give the Prince an early chance to press home his point to the man who will be inaugurated as US president today.

Mr Trump has previously said that ""the concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make US manufacturing non-competitive"".

Clarence House said no meeting had been scheduled, but conceded that the two men were likely to meet at a State visit for Mr Trump which is already being planned. A spokesman for the Prince said: ""It is the thing he is most concerned about. He regards  as the No 1 threat to the planet and it is the thing he cares most passionately about.""

In his foreword, he says: ""I hope this modest attempt to alert a global public to the 'wolf at the door' will make some small contribution towards encouraging requisite action; action that must be urgently scaled up, and scaled up now."" In 2015 the Prince addressed world leaders with a seven-minute speech at the  summit in Paris, saying: ""We must act now.""

He has also raised the subject in his so-called ""black spider memos"" to ministers. In 2005 he wrote in a letter to the then prime minister Tony Blair in which he raised ""the enormous problem of "" and suggested: ""You might find it worthwhile to explore not just what industry can do to cut emissions, but also ... energy efficiency could make a huge difference."" The Ladybird Expert series book was co-written by Tony Juniper, a fellow of the Cambridge Institute for Sustainability Leadership, and Emily Shuckburgh, a climate scientist at the British Antarctic Survey.

In an interview that will appear in tomorrow's Telegraph Magazine, Mr Juniper said: ""He wanted to present something everybody can read that cuts through some of the deliberately confusing misinformation that's been put out there over the years, which I know he is very frustrated about."" He said the Prince had been ""deeply involved at every stage"" of the book's production and insisted on it being peer-reviewed to make sure nothing in the text could be disputed.

After it was checked by seven academics, Mr Juniper said: ""These must be among the most thoroughly crawledover 5,000 words in any book anywhere."" This weekend the Prince will promote the book through a newspaper article and a television interview, an unusual move that reflects the urgency with which he views the subject.

The Prince has been expressing his concerns about  for decades and has become increasingly dismayed by the inaction of world leaders who have persistently failed to meet internationally agreed targets for reducing the causes of global warming. He will no doubt relish the chance to talk to Mr Trump, who discussed his plans for meeting the Prince when having his photograph taken for the cover of Time magazine at the end of last year. He noticed that the photographer, Nadav Kander, had also taken a portrait of the Prince for a 2013 cover of Time, and, according to Michael Scherer, who wrote a profile of Mr Trump, ""Trump was excited because he plans to meet with Prince Charles in the coming weeks, and offered to take him a copy of the Nadav portrait"".

A royal source said there was ""no meeting planned at this stage"".

Henry Samuel in Paris,UK,"December 13, 2017",News,"Daily Telegraph, The/The Sunday Telegraph (London, England) (Published as Daily Telegraph, The (London, England))  ","THE world is ""losing the battle"" against , Emmanuel Macron warned dozens of leaders yesterday at a summit in Paris aimed at jump-starting efforts to curb global warming.
The French president's statement came amid claims in the UK that he is seeking to turn Paris into the world's leading green finance capital while Brexit talks continue.

Sir Ed Davey, the Lib Dem former energy and  secretary, urged ministers to back the Bank of England's task force on climate-related financial disclosures and bring in new corporate requirements on their fossil fuel assets in order to ""tackle this threat and protect London"".

Greg Clark, the Business Secretary, brushed aside Sir Ed's concerns as he argued that Britain ""leads the world in climate finance"", adding that Theresa May was promoting the availability of green finance in the UK at the summit.

Some 127 heads of state, leaders of institutions, charities and businesses - including Bill Gates and Sir Richard Branson - gathered in the French capital to maintain momentum in the wake of Donald Trump's recent decision to pull the US out of the 2015 Paris climate accord. Mr Macron called the US president's move ""very bad news"" and ""aggressive"".

Mrs May said that the Paris accord was a ""historic agreement"" that was ""right morally but also economically"".

In a rebuttal to Mr Trump's claims it was bad for business, the Prime Minister said: ""You don't have to choose between cutting emissions and growing an economy. We choose both.""

But in his opening remarks at the One Planet summit, Mr Macron said: ""We're not moving quickly enough. We all need to act."" The world was, he added, ""nowhere near"" being able to honour a pledge to keep temperatures rises to between 1.5C (2.7F) and 2C (3.6F), and the planet was heading for up to a 3.5C (6.3F) increase at present.

Co-chaired by Jim Yong Kim, the president of the World Bank, and Antonio Guterres, the UN secretary-general, the summit focused on how financial institutions could stump up more funds and how to get corporate giants to embrace green policies.

Some 225 investment funds managing more than $26trillion in assets pledged to pile pressure on the 100 largest corporate greenhouse emitters to curb pollution and disclose climaterelated financial information.

PAUL POLMAN,UK,"June 5, 2017",Business,"Daily Telegraph, The/The Sunday Telegraph (London, England) (Published as Daily Telegraph, The (London, England))  ","For those present at the 2009 climate summit in Copenhagen, this week's events will prompt similar feelings of disappointment, anger and even disbelief that in the face of all the evidence, politicians sometimes get it wrong.
But the doomed Copenhagen summit spurred on a new generation of climate advocates. People in every sector from national governments, cities, states, youth movements, faith groups and businesses, became more determined than ever to continue the fight for a global programme of climate action that would protect economic growth, create jobs, improve air quality and public health and secure a stable climate for generations to come.

The result was the historic Paris Agreement. A legally binding framework for countries to cooperate in their pursuit of these goals. Its near universal adoption was a sign that around the word people finally understood that accelerated climate action was merely a form of enlightened self-interest. We reached a point where the costs of inaction were higher than the costs of action, and everyone could see it.

That's what makes this week's decision by the US president so incomprehensible, and I remain hopeful he will reconsider his position as more evidence of the impacts on the US economy come to light.

Thanks to the direction set by Paris, the markets for innovative clean energy and energy efficient technologies are expected to expand rapidly. In fact, the agreement is expected to unlock a $13.5trillion growth opportunity by 2030 as nearly 200 countries seek to accelerate their efforts to address .

The US is home to many leading businesses well placed to capture a growing share of this global market, already supporting over 3million clean energy jobs and with the potential to deliver many more. This opportunity, however, becomes harder to realise from outside the agreement.

Meanwhile, many of the jobs that the naysayers say are under threat from economic transition to a low carbon economy remain at risk because of other unstoppable factors. Increasing mechanisation and automation in many industries - including the US coal-mining industry - is the underlying driver of these shifts, not our efforts to tackle .

As economies have evolved, the nature of work has always changed. Our role as leaders is to ensure a just transition, one where those who lose out for no fault of their own are provided with alternative livelihoods in the new economy. And prioritising sustainable development and climate action, and capturing the economic benefits of doing so, is our best shot at building a new kind of economy that works for everyone, everywhere.

I grew up in a small town in the Netherlands which for years had been a centre of textile production. Few there work in textiles now, as jobs have moved overseas and new industries have been established. And while the transition was undoubtedly difficult at the time, the future for the overwhelming majority has proved brighter than the past.

But this is about more than personal anecdotes. The Global Commission on the Economy and Climate has shown that a low carbon transition, with increased investment in renewable energy, energy efficiency, clean cities, better land use and low carbon infrastructure offers us our best chance of higher quality economic growth in the decades ahead, with $90trillion needed to be spent on sustainable infrastructure globally by 2030.

And that's to say nothing of the moral arguments and our responsibility to protect vulnerable communities now as well as future generations. Any action that seeks to slow our efforts to address  can only hurt those most vulnerable to rising sea levels and extreme weather events, whether in New Orleans or Papua New Guinea. Even in the developed world, climate instability would leave our children and grandchildren with a level of increased resource scarcity and economic hardship that they have done nothing to deserve.

That's why the response from thousands of business leaders, city mayors and state governors has been so immediate and so potent. It's why the response of the European and Chinese political leaders has been so robust. And it's why our resolve to carry on regardless is so strengthened.

Today, therefore, I believe we should celebrate the Paris Agreement; the agreement we all helped to create. One which is more than a legal document but rather a shared global commitment to action, to chart a better direction for our businesses, our cities and our world. A global movement of this strength is bigger than any one nation state, any one person. And it's why together we will succeed in tackling  and building a brighter future for all.

Maurice Tulloch,UK,"August 12, 2017",News,"Daily Telegraph, The/The Sunday Telegraph (London, England) (Published as Daily Telegraph, The (London, England))  ","The insurance industry exists to manage risk; as far as possible we aim to prevent or minimise the impact of losses before they happen. Burning fossil fuels gives rise to short, medium and long-term risks for insurers, investors, and our customers and society alike. And yet governments continue to promote the production of oil, gas and coal with subsidies.
The OECD estimates that $160bn to $200bn (?123bn to ?154bn) a year goes towards supporting fossil fuel production and consumption in OECD countries and key emerging economies. This actively contributes to air pollution, health problems and premature deaths, as well as the increase in extreme weather events that comes with . This policy costs taxpayers twice - firstly for the subsidies, and then again as public funds are needed to deal with health costs and .

Just recently, the Health and Environment Alliance launched a report that laid out the costs of the health impacts that come from fossil fuel subsidies. In the UK, health costs arising from fossil fuel driven air pollution are almost five times higher than the subsidies paid. Over $6bn of public money is spent on the industry, and the health costs from premature deaths linked to air pollution run to over $30bn.

Globally, it is estimated that every year there are 6.5 million deaths from respiratory infections, strokes, heart attacks, lung cancer and chronic lung disease that are directly attributable to the combustion of fossil fuels. Besides the immediate public health impacts of bad air, the broader effects of  come with real costs. A recent report by the Lancet Commission on Health and  made a compelling case that global morbidity and mortality rates are intimately linked to . Warmer temperatures create water scarcity and food insecurity in certain regions, resulting in malnutrition and even starvation. Deadly heatwaves have become a threat to one third of the world's population. Viral pandemics are being exacerbated by warmer temperatures, as mosquito-born diseases like Zika and dengue fever thrive in a hotter, wetter world.

These combined impacts are taxing public health systems and private insurers alike, on top of the costs of property damage and loss brought about by sea level rises and storm surges, flooding, and other extreme weather events. Yet world leaders continue to underwrite one of the contributing causes.

The report argues that ending subsidies to fossil fuels would produce a rare quadruple win for society. First, national budgets could grow and deficits shrink with increased revenue from taxes currently unpaid by oil, gas and coal companies, generally delivered in the form of tax breaks and concessions. Second, those budgets could go further with less to spend on the healthcare costs associated with local air pollution. Third, the current and eventual costs of reacting to and adapting for the impacts of  would be reduced. Finally, the public would be healthier and more productive in the workforce, providing even more of an economic boost.

None of this is straightforward.There are people who rely on subsidised fuel. Any transition needs to be managed carefully to mitigate any social impacts and to ensure continuity of energy supply. And we must recognise the knotty issue of carbon entanglement, where governments and asset owners may be vested in the status quo. The fact remains that having a price that reflects the true cost of the fuel would enable these discussions to happen with more transparency.

The G7 have, in fact, already promised to end fossil fuel subsidies by 2025. We should congratulate Canada, for example, for announcing moves to end its own subsidies in its recent budget. Italy, which next chairs the G20, has published a subsidy inventory.

These are steps in the right direction. They won't solve the problem of  alone, and more countries need to get involved. But the fact remains that subsidies are ultimately unsustainable.

Robert Mendick Chief RepoRteR,UK,"March 13, 2017",News,"Daily Telegraph, The/The Sunday Telegraph (London, England) (Published as Daily Telegraph, The (London, England))  "," questions are raised today over hundreds of millions of pounds of British taxpayers' money being ""wasted"" on  projects such as an Ethiopian wind farm and Kenyan solar power plant.
A Daily Telegraph investigation shows little benefit so far from a ?2 billion foreign aid programme to tackle  that was established eight years ago. One scheme, costing ?260million of UK taxpayers' money, has produced only enough renewable electricity to power the equivalent of 100 British households.

Projects including solar parks in Kenya and Mali, a rubbish-burning power plant in the Maldives and wind farming project in Ethiopia are all earmarked for funding from the scheme.

The investigation raises major concerns over the use of international aid money to fund complex renewable energy schemes in some of the world's poorest countries. It will also reignite the row over the Government's commitment, championed by David Cameron, to ring fence the ?12billion annual foreign aid budget, which is fixed at 0.7 per cent of national income.

Critics have accused the Government of ""scandalously wasting"" taxpayers' money on the schemes.

While officials insist publicly the  schemes are working and should only be judged in 2023 at its end point, the Department for International Development (Dfid) has expressed concern over delays to projects and the management of them.

One senior source said ministers inside Dfid are questioning whether the money would have been better spent on humanitarian causes instead. The  complex set of schemes - known as Climate Investment Funds - are run by the World Bank, with almost one-third of the ?6.75billion total funding provided by the UK Government. No other country has put in so much cash.

The funds, consisting of four separate schemes, are intended to kick-start green energy projects such as the building of large-scale wind and solar farms in poorer countries and environmentally friendly public transport.

One of the four schemes - the ?630million Scaling Up Renewable Energy Project (SREP) - was set up with the help of ?268 million from the Dfid and the now defunct Department for Energy and .

But at the halfway point of the project to provide renewable energy and improve energy access in 28 of the world's poorest countries, including Haiti, Ethiopia and Bangladesh, little appears to have been achieved by way of effective results. To date, just three SREP-funded projects - two in Honduras and one in Nepal - are producing either green electricity or improving access to it. A further 20 approved projects are not making any positive impact, according to an annual report published at the end of last year.

A second scheme - The Climate Technology Fund (CTF) - to which the UK has contributed ?1.2billion, is intended to deliver green electricity and reduce emissions in ""middle income"" countries including gas and oil rich Kazakhstan as well as India, Turkey and Morocco. More than halfway through the scheme, set up in 2009, it is supplying about seven per cent of the renew-able energy expected by 2023. To date, only 26 projects out of 70 approved schemes under the CTF have reported any benefit. The vast majority of the projects do not record any figures at all.

A senior Dfid source said: ""Ministers have called in a number of climate programmes for close scrutiny to ensure they are on track and delivering.""

The insider added: ""The money would be better spent on our humanitarian response with proven results than some of the incredibly complex climate programmes.""

Dr John Constable, director of the Renewable Energy Foundation, a charity strongly critical of British green energy policy, said: ""Overseas development projects have long been plagued with expensive failures, but the current crop of  and renewable energy initiatives are showing strong signs of being the most negligently conducted and scandalously wasteful to date.""

The Government defended the performance of the funds. A spokesman said: ""The Climate Investment Fund is helping provide the world's poorest people with stronger defences to extreme weather which can cause lifethreatening crises such as floods, droughts and famine.

""The UK's investment is already delivering results by producing reliable sources of food, improving infrastructure and giving people access to clean energy, and all programmes are on course to meet the published performance targets for 2023.""

The  gambit has always been a Goldilocks story. The speed and damage of  had to be not too hot (or rapid) and not too cold (or slow), it had to be just right. Too rapid or hot and renewables would never work. Too delayed or cool and the world could wait for better technologies. Renewables seemed right only in the just right scenario.

But, what if  creates more clouds, calms the wind, stops rivers flowing, or wipes out bio-crops in regions where panels, turbines, hydro and biofuel stock are located?

You would think CSIRO would research the risk. But it has nothing to say. The US Environmental Protection Agency says no more than that ¡°the impacts of  on wind and solar power is still a developing area of research¡±.

Both are happy to predict calamity in every other aspect of . Fortunately, some others have been thinking about it.

David MacKay, chief scientific adviser to Britain¡¯s Department of Energy and  from 2009 to 2014, thought the idea of renewables powering Britain was an ¡°appalling delusion¡±.

He said Britain should focus on nuclear power and carbon-capture technologies. The same could be said of many nations with the same climate ? that is, much of northern Europe and the northern US.

However, he said solar could be an important power source in other countries, where sunny summers coincided with a big demand for electricity.

So, how are renewables going to cope, even in the right climate? Some researchers have been doing their homework, and all is not well in renewable-land.

There are big hopes for better energy efficiency in heating and cooling buildings. A US study looked at the effect of projected  in 10 climate zones across the US and concluded that buildings in half of the zones would miss the target of net-zero energy. ¡°The climate-driven change in heating and cooling energy demand is the main driver for that failure.¡± (Shen and Lior, Energy, 2016).

There are big hopes for wind energy. A study of projected changes across southern Africa suggests long-term ¡°mean wind resource potential¡± will ¡°most likely¡± remain unchanged by 2050. However, ¡°decreased wind speed during winter along the coastal South Africa is a problem because winter is the season of low wind speeds and high electricity demand¡¯¡¯ (Fant, Applied Energy, 2016).

And solar energy? A study of the Black Sea region projects no great disturbance for solar energy. Unfortunately, it excludes key variables for large-scale PV power generation such as atmospheric clearness, components of global solar radiation, reflected radiation related to surrounding surface albedo and sunshine hours at the daily, monthly and yearly scale (Gunderson, Environmental Science & Policy, 2015). Big holes there. Assessments for northern Europe suggest a 14 per cent loss of insolation (Jerez, Nature Communications, 2015).

Mackay was right.

And hydropower? A study of the impact of  on hydropower in Brazil, a huge source of energy, found most projects ¡°highly susceptible to changes in water inflow patterns¡±. Energy will be lower because ¡°the average precipitations are projected to decrease and the drown periods are likely to increase in the Amazonian region¡± (de Queiroz, Renewable Energy, 2016).

And in Europe? The estimated average annual variations in run-off in the Greater Alpine Region are within ¡¾10 per cent, but up to -30 per cent for the warm-dry scenario in southern France and northern Italy (Wagner, Environmental Earth Sciences, 2017).

And biofuels? In The Philippines, biofuels, as well as the whole agriculture sector, are exposed to risks. It appears that the frequency of occurrence of strong typhoons is growing. Results here are not too bad: about 1 per cent of the biofuel feedstock yield is at risk (Stromberg, Environmental Science & Policy, 2011). Still, some heartache for a poor country.

ALAN KOHLER,Australia,"February 4, 2017",Feature,"Australian, The/Weekend Australian/Australian Magazine, The (Australia) (Published as Weekend Australian (Australia))  ","Trump¡¯s  stance directly challenges CEOs and corporate policies
The death of diplomatic bullshit may be the best thing about Donald Trump: his apparent bollocking of the Australian Prime Minister this week was bracing and refreshing. Long may such candour continue.

That conversation and most of the major Trump action of the past week have been all about refugees and immigration, and the corporate world would have been happy to watch from the sidelines.

But very soon, possibly next week, CEOs will be confronted with a problem: how to respond to America¡¯s coming  U-turn.

President Trump is an open  doubter, if not denier, who has called the whole thing a hoax invented by the Chinese.

His campaign ideas were drawn up an outright denier, Myron Ebell, director of global warming and international environmental policy at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a Washington think tank.

¡°The people have rejected the expertariat,¡± he said this week. ¡°And I think with good reason because I think the expertariat have been wrong about one thing after another, including climate policy. The expert class, it seems to me, is full of arrogance or hubris.¡± Yes, you¡¯ve got to watch these experts.

One of the first things the Trump team did after inauguration on January 20 was to replace the  page on the White House website with a page headed ¡°An America First Energy Policy¡± that says: ¡°President Trump is committed to eliminating harmful and unnecessary policies such as the Climate Action Plan ¡¦¡± Within hours of Trump being sworn in, all mentions of  were deleted from the White House website.

On the other hand, pretty much the entire corporate world is on board with the need to reduce carbon emissions to limit global warming ? it¡¯s become almost an article of faith, a hook on which to hang corporate social responsibility policies. Most companies have it as the centrepiece of their CSR agenda and business lobby groups have all been dragged by their members onto the train.

Even the Minerals Council of Australia¡¯s website says (through gritted teeth?): ¡°The minerals industry acknowledges that sustained global action is required to reduce the scale of human induced .¡± And while the Business Council of Australia¡¯s energy policy leads with the need to deliver efficient and competitively-priced energy to households and business, it says this must be done while ¡°managing Australia¡¯s greenhouse gas emissions in line with our 2030 emissions reduction target¡±.

This week Myron Ebell, now back at his think tank, said he thought President Trump would pull out of the Paris agreement ¡°within days¡±.

That might be wrong, of course: Ebell is not in the White House and Trump seems to think a little more highly of experts than he does (although not much ? Steve Bannon wrote his immigration ban executive order). And it¡¯s not that the Trump White House is a model of careful, consistent policy formulation, so anything is ¡©possible.

Meanwhile Trump¡¯s Secretary of State, former Exxon Mobil CEO Rex Tillerson, said he thought the US should maintain its seat at the Paris table. ¡°The risk of  does exist,¡± he told his confirmation hearing. ¡°Action should be taken¡±.

But Tillerson embodies the challenge that all CEOs are about to face. Exxon Mobil¡¯s website says: ¡°The risk of  is clear and the risk warrants action. Increasing carbon emissions in the atmosphere are having a warming effect. There is a broad scientific and policy consensus that action must be taken to further quantify and assess the risks.¡± What¡¯s more: ¡°The company has continuously, publicly and openly researched and discussed the risks of , carbon life cycle analysis and emissions reductions.¡± Tillerson can hardly now disavow all that and support Trump¡¯s plan to pull out of the Paris agreement and reverse the US Government¡¯s  policies. ¡°Hypocrisy¡± would barely cover it.

If Tillerson can¡¯t stop Trump pulling America out of the Paris Agreement and, in general, reversing the Obama position on , what does he do? Of course he can, and probably will, just go along doing his own thing and saying he disagrees with the President on this issue, but this will surely get awkward if he has to go to a meeting with world leaders and implement the policy.

For other CEOs the dilemma might not quite as sharp as it is for Tillerson, but like him they will have to choose between sticking with their existing, stated, position on  or disagreeing with the President.

Uber CEO Travis Kalanick has already seen what happens if you get this choice wrong: Uber has been subjected to deletion campaigns and petitions since breaking the strike at JFK Airport called over Trump¡¯s immigration ban. On Inauguration Day protesters stood outside Uber¡¯s office in San Francisco with signs saying ¡°Uber collaborates with Trump¡±.

Its competitor, Lyft, jumped in and condemned Trump, trying to take advantage of Kalanick¡¯s discomfort. Now Uber is trying to climb back, saying that Trump¡¯s travel ban is wrong.But immigration is not a corporate issue, and companies usually don¡¯t have ringing statements about it on their websites.",Trump¡¯s climate stance directly challenges CEOs

In an official submission to a Senate inquiry, the Defence ¡©Department has laid out what it sees as the national security consequences of human-induced ¡©, warning that dealing with the fallout from ¡©global warming could increase the burden on Australia¡¯s military.

It paints an uncertain, yet bleak, picture:  intensifying natural disasters and the mass movement of people across the region. It features as a kind of wildcard that could tax the capabilities of soldiers and imperil Australia¡¯s energy markets, upon which defence relies heavily.

Defence describes human-¡©induced  as a ¡°threat multiplier¡¯¡¯ which will intersect with existing problems of population density, poor governance, poverty and ethnic rivalry for food, water and resources. It will also increase the frequency, and intensify the effects, of natural disasters, potentially obliging ¡©Defence to devote more of its resources to disaster relief among Australia¡¯s neighbours.

¡°Many of the states in Australia¡¯s region face some or all of these challenges, in addition to being vulnerable to  impacts such as temperature and sea level rise,¡¯¡¯ Defence says. ¡°Unmitigated,  could exacerbate the potential for conflict and the consequence of any -related threats could lead to an increase in the demand for a wide spectrum of Defence response.¡¯¡¯ It is ¡°too early¡± to say precisely what resource pressures will be placed on Australia, but it warns ¡°the current most likely forecast climate changes may require higher levels of commitment that may create concurrency pressure for Defence from as early as the middle of the next decade, or earlier if  related impacts on security threats accelerate¡±.

¡°Although the full range of impacts are not yet able to be determined, there is potential for  to exacerbate existing threats and future governments may increase demands on the ADF to impose new commitments. These impacts could include an ¡©increase in illegal, unreported, or unregulated fishing or irregular maritime arrivals to Australia.¡± Citing conflicts in Syria and Africa, Defence argues  could exacerbate ethnic or other social grievances in Australia¡¯s region, fostering terrorism or cross-border conflict.

¡° may also contribute to greater irregular migration pressure in vulnerable counties to Australia¡¯s north, potentially becoming a substantial security threat for Australia.¡± Defence says  ¡°will exacerbate storms of increasing severity that will continue to impact national electricity infrastructure¡±.

"JASON BETTS, PETER BRIGGS, OPINION",Australia,"May 5, 2017",LegalAffairs,"Australian, The/Weekend Australian/Australian Magazine, The (Australia) (Published as Australian, The (Australia))  "," litigation is set to emerge as a significant risk for ¡©corporations across all sectors of the Australian economy.
This is because of the fact that momentum is gathering for regulatory investigations and shareholder class actions against com¡©panies that fail to properly disclose the transition costs of moving to a lower carbon economy.

The attraction of these claims to regulators and litigation funders is that they won¡¯t face the trad¡©itional obstacle of ¡°proving the science¡± of .

They can also be brought under existing disclosure laws that are used to support the majority of regulatory investigations and shareholder class actions in respect of disclosure practices.

It is often overlooked that Australia has a history of  litigation ? but almost always in the form of environmental impact assessment cases involving federal and state planning laws.

These cases have challenged decisions to permit major construction projects on the ground that there was a failure to properly assess the environmental and  impact of the projects, such as projected sea-level rises or coastal erosion.

This species of  litigation is limited in its effectiveness ? the claims generally rely on administrative law, meaning courts cannot reassess the environmental impact of the underlying project or impose environ¡©mental sanctions. The main remedy is forcing the decision-maker to reconsider the approval decision, this time having more detailed regard to  issues.

That is a slow, case-by-case process that has not really engaged with the broader national and global debate over  impacts and remediation.

Similarly, while ¡°mass tort¡± claims are possible, they generally also face major obstacles ? not everyone has standing to sue in tort, and even when they can, establishing causation ? the link between a particular defendant¡¯s conduct and an impact on the environment ? requires difficult scientific evidence.

The cases are fraught with uncertainty and expense. None of these avenues is attractive to ¡©pro¡©moters of class action litigation, nor do they raise issues within the ambit of the Australian Securities & Investments Commission or other financial regulators.

That may be about to change. Regulators around the world (including ASIC) are increasingly rec¡©ognising the financial impact of the ¡°transition risks¡± of .

What are these transition risks? Examples include the increased frequency of extreme weather events creating a greater risk that a business will lose access to key ¡©inputs such as water and sewerage; or the increased risk of power ¡©outages creating greater costs for companies that depend sig¡©nificantly on energy transmission.

A further risk arises from the likelihood of changes to environmental or emission regulations that could cause fossil fuels to be repriced as part of a move to a lower carbon norm, meaning the balance sheet value of proven ¡©deposits in the extractive industry become unrealisable at historical values.

This risk of ¡°stranded assets¡± is particularly topical, given Aus¡©tralia¡¯s commitment to the Paris Agreement and the impact that policies that limit global warming will have on fuel reserves ¡©currently sitting in Australian corporate ¡©balance sheets. All of these risks could be material to an Australian company¡¯s financial position and could affect the costs and profitability of its core business.

Material risks are required to be disclosed under a variety of Australian laws; the ASX listing rules require the immediate disclosure of material risks and the ASX has recently expanded its guidance to specifically include the disclosure of ¡°environmental and social sustainability risks¡±.

Most shareholder class actions filed in Australia to date (especially those supported by litigation funders) have involved allegations that a listed entity ¡©failed to disclose its exposure to a material risk in a timely fashion.

Often this information has involved traditional business risks affecting profit and earnings forecasts, but precisely the same principles could be applied to companies that do not consider or disclose the impact of the trans¡©ition risks associated with .

If those risks ultimately do ¡©affect the company¡¯s operations, it is easy to envisage ASIC or a class action promoter initiating an investigation into when it knew about the risk to its business and whether the risk should have been disclosed earlier.

We are seeing exactly that trend emerge in Britain and the US, with the regulators in both ¡©jurisdictions initiating investi¡©gations in the past 24 months into listed entities regarding the ¡©adequacy of disclosure of business risk from  in annual reports.

They are looking at whether the balance sheet value of proven resource reserves have been mat¡©erially overstated in view of likely future emission restrictions.

The focus of foreign regulators is often predictive of local trends ? both regulatory and of the class action litigation risk.

The result is a heightened need for all Australian companies to examine closely their exposure to the transition risks associated with  and the move to a lower carbon economy and to ¡©ensure that all foreseeable risks are assessed and disclosed where necessary.Jason Betts and Peter Briggs are partners at Herbert Smith Freehills.

¡°Research and other professional activities are professionally rewarded only if they are channelled in certain directions approved by a politicised academic establishment ? funding, ease of getting your papers published, getting hired in prestigious positions, appointments to prestigious committees and boards, professional recognition, etc.

He is helping AGL managing director Andy Vesey¡¯s policy for an ¡°orderly transition¡± out of coal to renewable energy as the company encounters protests that its plans to shut down the Liddell power station in the NSW Hunter Valley could threaten power supplies.

Mr Chappel, who joined AGL as head of government and community relations in February last year, has been a chief of staff to NSW Liberal minister Rob Stokes, and linked to his party¡¯s moderate faction. He is a former president of the Young Liberals in NSW and was once touted as a candidate in the Sydney state seats of Davidson or Ku-ring-gai.

Mr Chappel told The Australian in 2011 that he had ¡°started to feel quite disconnected¡± from some policy positions taken by the federal Liberal Party almost a decade earlier, especially on . ¡°I got quite uncomfortable, especially since their position ignored the science,¡± he said.

Mr Chappel scored a British Council Chevening scholarship to Imperial College London in 2009, where he studied for a masters degree in energy policy.

While in Britain, he worked as a researcher at the University of Oxford, on projects mapping sustainable development pathways for Rwanda and on applied ¡©research with French development agency AFD about the use of economic tools to address environmental issues.

Critics of Mr Chappel within the NSW Liberal right faction say he is in the ¡°vanguard¡± of  activists who believe they can influence corporate policies by working in executive positions for change.

The Australian reported yesterday that former GetUp! campaigns director and Labor staffer Skye Laris, known for her views on , is now senior manager, public advocacy, at AGL.

The insurance member at the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority, Geoff Summerhayes, said  impacts had already ¡°moved from being a hypothetical risk to a real risk with impact¡±.

The directive comes in the wake of intense uncertainty surrounding the future of Australian climate legislation over the last week, with Labor apparently walking away from a firm 50 per cent renewable energy commitment and Scott Morrison declining to rule out publicly funding new coal-fired power stations.

¡°While climate risks have been broadly recognised, they have often been seen as a future problem or a non-financial problem. The key point I want to make today, and that APRA wants to be explicit about, is that this is no longer the case,¡± Mr Summerhayes told the insurance industry in Sydney yesterday.

¡°We don¡¯t see this jumping to the top of our proprieties, but the horizon has come closer and this should be on people¡¯s agenda.¡± Mr Summerhayes, a former Suncorp executive, called on the industry and the regulators to systemically monitor, disclose and talk about climate risks.

He declined to comment on policies or political manoeuvres, but said that in general regulators preferred smooth transitions rather than abrupt changes.

¡°This whole area is so murky and so imprecise that to try and get some precision is nonsense,¡± Mr Newman said.

¡°Why on earth APRA would want to be getting into  is beyond me. Seems to me a chance to create a bigger ¡©bureaucracy and create more rules.¡± Mr Newman said insurers and banks already incorporated natural disaster risks in their actuarial models.

This week an unlikely alliance of business organisations, including the Business Council of Australia, the Australian Industry Group, the Energy Council and the Australian Council of Trade Unions, penned a joint letter arguing the erratic climate debate in Canberra was undermining investment and increasing the cost of planning for the future.

Mr Summerhayes said the industry and regulators should not be sticking their heads in the sand.

¡°It¡¯s unsafe for entities or regulators to ignore risks just because there is uncertainty, or even controversy, about the policy outlook. Like all risks, it is better they are explicitly considered and managed as appropriate, rather than simply ignored or neglected,¡± Mr Summerhayes said.

¡°Climate risks also have potential system-wide implications that APRA and other regulators here and abroad are paying much closer attention to.¡± The insurance sector has a mixed history with action on . Suncorp has exceeded its natural hazard claims allowance in nine of the past 10 years. IAG has run over budget in eight of the past 10 years.

He said people were ¡°constructively¡± engaging with this challenge.

But only 18 per cent think the Turnbull government is doing a good job tackling global warming, a new poll has found.

An annual survey by Ipsos, which has examined public opinion on  for the past 12 years, shows eight in 10 agree human activity is contributing to  - 42 per cent say humans are mainly or entirely responsible while 38 per cent believe  is caused partly by humans and partly by natural processes.

Just 3 per cent of respondents think there is no such thing as , a share that has hardly shifted during the past decade. Another 12 per cent believe  is caused entirely or mostly by natural processes.

Ipsos researcher Jennifer Brook said public perceptions about  in Australia have stabilised in recent years.

""Despite this maturation of belief in , there is still confusion as to the exact causes and frustration around conflicting opinions resulting in confusion on the topic of ,"" she said.

""It is these details that still seem to be up for debate, and complicate people's understanding of the causes.""

Energy policy has been a key political theme this year, with the Turnbull government unveiling major policies including the National Energy Guarantee and the expansion of Snowy Hydro.

That may have contributed to a rise in the share of Australians who think combating  is primarily the federal government's duty. The proportion saying climate action is mainly the federal government's responsibility was 41 per cent, the equal highest since the question was first asked in 2010.

But only 3 per cent of respondents rated the federal government's response to  as ""very good"", with a further 15 per cent rating it as ""fairly good."" More than four in 10 rated the government's performance on  as poor or very poor.

The share of respondents who felt the international community was doing a good or very good job of tackling  rose to 22 per cent, 3 percentage points higher than last year.

Almost half of respondents (47 per cent) agreed  is already causing more frequent and extreme storm events, the destruction of the Great Barrier Reef (47 per cent) and causing more frequent and extreme droughts (47 per cent). A slightly smaller share agreed  is already causing more frequent and extreme floods (45 per cent) and more frequent and extreme bushfires (44 per cent).

Those aged less than 50 are much more likely to think  is mostly or entirely caused by human activity than those aged over 50. Australians are sceptical about letting market forces alone determine how much power is generated from renewable sources. Only 27 per cent supported a deregulated, ""market only"" approach with no national target for the uptake of renewable energy.

Seven in 10 were in favour of the federal government setting a national target for renewable energy use (32 per cent strongly support this) with just 15 per cent opposed.

Clancy Yeates,Australia,"February 25, 2017",Business,"Sydney Morning Herald, The (Australia) ","The growing spectre of a carbon bubble has prompted changes in the attitudes of big business, writes Clancy Yeates.
Ask a senior banker about the big financial risks that keep them up at night, and  probably won't be one of them. Yet that may soon change, as investors controlling trillions of dollars, and powerful regulators, turn their sights on the potentially big financial risks created by a world that's getting warmer.

Even as US President Donald Trump seeks to reverse global moves to lower carbon emissions, a group of corporate giants and regulators have decided the purely financial risks of  are too great to be left unchecked.

In July this year, a group of global firms with combined market value of $US1.5 trillion and $US20 trillion in assets will deliver recommendations to G20 leaders on how to avoid the risk of serious financial dislocation caused by a carbon bust.

The group's draft report in December called for sweeping changes to how much big companies should tell investors about their  exposure, and how they plan to manage these risks.

And as a carbon-intensive economy with $2.1 trillion in retirement savings that is heavily exposed to equity markets, Australia has plenty at stake in this debate.

""I think the penny is dropping for everyone that  represents one of the most important financial risks for investors,"" says Ross Barry, head of research at $59 billion fund First State Super. ""It's not a 50-year thing, it's a here and now problem.""

Yet at the moment, these risks remain highly uncertain, and therefore have potential to be a source of market instability.

Of most concern to regulators, assets spanning energy, mining, agriculture, transport and manufacturing could be significantly affected by policies to stem carbon emissions, or shifts in technology.

Financial markets are designed to ""price in"" such risks, but they cannot currently do that because they simply don't have the information.

Bank of England governor Mark Carney said in December it was clear investors did not have the information they need to determine which stocks would be most vulnerable to weather risks of , or who might have the winning strategies to profit.

""This must change if financial markets are going to do what they do best: allocate capital to manage risks and seize new opportunities. Without the necessary information, market adjustments to  will be incomplete, late and potentially destabilising,"" he said.

Avoiding this scenario - a ""carbon bubble"" - is front of mind for a growing number of investors, pressuring the highest levels of corporate Australia to take the issue seriously.

Most corporate commentary on  is buried in sustainability reports that few investors read too closely. It's handled by the teams that deal with environmental, social and governance issues, rather than the bean counters.

And even when companies do disclose more systematic data about their carbon foot print, this too is patchy and inconsistent.

It's been estimated there are 400 schemes around the word designed to boost carbon disclosure - but such an ad-hoc approach makes it near impossible to get a clear picture of where the climate risks lie in the financial markets.

Concerns about such risks among investors, regulators and the emitters themselves prompted the G20's Financial Stability Board (FSB) to appoint a taskforce looking at climate risks in the markets, including some of the world's biggest companies and investors, such as Blackrock, AXA, JP Morgan and BHP Billiton.

BHP Billiton's vice-president of sustainability and , Dr Fiona Wild, is one member of the panel, which is chaired by billionaire Michael Bloomberg and is recommending a voluntary disclosure regime on climate risks. It will report to G20 leaders when they meet in Hamburg this July.

""Corporate reporting of material risks has always been a feature of disclosure regimes. But I think reporting on  is often potentially misunderstood, or unavailable, or non-comparable or incomplete,"" Wild says.

Such a lack of consistent data creates an information vacuum of sorts - and in financial markets,that can breed instability. That risk is particularly acute when there are deep-seated or ""structural"" changes taking place, such as moving away from fossil fuels towards new types of energy.

There is a fear this instability could spill into the broader financial system, through loans held by banks, insurance policies, or investments of pension funds.

And Australia may well be more exposed than most.

AMP Capital last year estimated Australia's economy would need a bigger reduction in its emissions intensity than the United States, Europe, China, India, Japan, Korea and Indonesia, if we are to meet a commitment to limit global temperature rises to 2 degrees.

It found a carbon price of $50 a tonne would put about 9 per cent of the ASX 200 index at risk, with the vast bulk of these emissions coming from utilities and miners. Surprisingly, this was lower than the MSCI world index of global shares. But either way, it is a very substantial pool of at-risk assets.

The Australian Prudential Regulation Authority last week also made the first detailed comments from a domestic regulator, showing how seriously they view these risks.

The shift towards less carbon-intensive forms of energy could trigger a ""significant repricing of carbon-intensive resources and activities and reallocation of capital"", executive board member Geoff Summerhayes said. APRA was ""keenly aware of potential systemic implications"".

Globally, Bank of England researchers conducted a ""thought experiment"" recently on the central bank's blog, which sought to quantifying the potential size of losses that could face investors.

If big energy companies were forced to start cutting their dividends by 5 per cent a year from 2020, until dividends reached zero in 2050, they said this would wipe out some 40 per cent of these shares' value. That would be equal to a fall of 11 per cent in the entire world's stockmarkets.

""If such a repricing were to take place reasonably rapidly, as we have argued it could, it might have the potential to entail risks to financial stability. And, historically, equity price changes of this size have sometimes been associated with shocks affecting the wider economy, not least given the impact they have on individuals' wealth,"" the researchers wrote.

It is these types of broader financial stability risks, as opposed to environmental concerns, that are primarily motivating investors and regulators through the FSB.

The response being proposed is to elevate  into an issue that is no longer buried in sustainability reports, but something that's in the financial reports released to market.

""Once you put it on your financial statements, companies start to treat it differently,"" says the chief executive of the Investor Group on , Emma Herd.

"" is one of those issues that will never be material in any historical reporting period, right up until the point where your whole industry goes out of business.""

For Australian companies, which have seen  slip off the agenda of government, this could all prove to be quite a wake-up call.

BHP and AGL Energy - which are regularly cited by climate investment experts as disclosing much more on climate risks than most - may provide a taste of what awaits much of corporate Australia.

Both have released detailed modelling that sets out how they would be affected if the world meets its target of limiting the temperature rise from  to 2 degrees.

AMP Capital's head of ESG investment research, Dr Ian Woods, says this is a very different exercise to estimating how a company would fare under current government policies.

A world in which temperature rises are kept at 2 degrees or less should be ""a very core policy that companies should be thinking about and disclosing on"", he says.

Yet beyond AGL and BHP, Woods says disclosure by Australian companies along these specific lines is ""pretty patchy"".

Scenario planning in corporate offices may not sound too exciting, but Woods says it is important because it is a way to force executives to think about uncomfortable outcomes - like forcing banks to ""stress test"" themselves against a collapse in the housing market.

""It forces them to think of the world in maybe a way they don't want the world to go and to think about how will their business be positioned in that scenario,"" Woods says.

AGL, an electricity giant, conducted this type of scenario analysis in 2016.

It showed that while current government policy would lower the net present value of its power stations by 5 per cent, limiting global warming to 2 degrees would lower the base NPV by some 25 per cent compared with no carbon price. There is also potential to gain, of course, such as by investing in renewable energy assets.

The chief economist at AGL Energy, Tim Nelson, says that by revealing their  modelling, companies could give investors greater assurance they were attuned to the risks, and opportunities, on offer.

Aside from disclosing their climate strategies, companies also need robust governance arrangements to show the issue was being taken seriously and acted on, such as board level engagement, he says.

""It's not just the materials, but it's also the governance and strategic aspects of how boards are dealing with ,"" Nelson says.

More broadly, initiatives such as the FSB-led push on  disclosure can make the inevitable change to cleaner energy a less bumpy ride for investors, customers, and affected staff.

""The more sudden the structural change in the real economy, the more you see negative effects, whether it's on consumers, employees or investors,"" he says.

If there is a ""glide path"" rather than abrupt change - something that greater disclosure should encourage - ""it's a better outcome for all those stakeholders"".

BHP, the world's largest mining company, also undertook a similar analysis in 2015. Wild says this showed that even on a fast move away from fossil fuels, the low cost and diversity of its energy and mining assets shielded returns.

""Even if the world shifts away from fossil fuels, there's still value there from those high quality, low-cost assets in our portfolio.""

Even so, the exercise still forces boards to look through any current decisions through the lens of climate risks.

""It gives you a frame to think about the future. We don't know what the future looks like, but scenario analysis enables us to think about a broad range of plausible but divergent futures, and make investment decisions today that are resilient across that range,"" Wild says.

As well as big emitters, companies with indirect exposure to these risks, such as banks, face pressure to reveal more about how they are handling climate risks.

Westpac, ANZ Bank, National Australia Bank and Commonwealth have all made noises about shifting towards more renewable energy and managing their carbon risks. After shareholders pressure, they all disclose more data on their ""financed emissions"" - the carbon footprint of their business customers.

Kate Mackenzie, head of finance and investment at the Climate Institute, says another important recommendation from the FSB taskforce has been for banks to disclose extra details on their potential exposure by geography and industry. Insurers would also be asked to disclose their modelling of climate risks.

""The location of assets or collateral is important for climate impacts and an increasingly useful way of analysing carbon risk going forward,"" Mackenzie says.

As companies grapple with the many unknowns, pension funds are making their own assessments of how  might hurt their members' nest eggs.

This is happening across several funds' entire portfolio, and not only in the ""sustainable"" options.

One fund leading the charge is Local Government Super, which manages savings of council workers. It was at the forefront of moves to divest from tobacco stocks, a move many others have followed, and it has predicted a similar level of awareness about the investment risks from .

Bill Hartnett, head of sustainability at the $10 billion fund, says it already applies a screen to all its investments to determine potential  risks.

This policy, introduced in 2014, has resulted in the fund divesting from 25 companies that derive more than 33 per cent of their revenue from coal mining, oil tar sands and coal-fired generators.

""Once you start to accept the science of climate and that there are significant risks associated with it, and it's fundamental to fulfilling our fiduciary duty,"" Hartnett says. ""Screening is one of many approaches we take, along with low carbon investments and shareholder engagement and voting, to address these risks.""

He says the FSB taskforce proposals, if adopted, would give investors a better handle on managing  risks on behalf of members.

""It will enable us to better understand and compare the risks and measure the risks,"" Hartnett says.

First State Super has taken a different approach, though it too is putting all of its assets under the microscope to test their vulnerability to climate risks.

Head of research Ross Barry says while it has the option of dumping stocks because of  risk, it has not yet gone down this path.

Rather than divestment, the fund is more focused on engagement with big carbon emitters. Barry says this, too, can have a real impact for investors, especially in a market like Australia where a few large pension funds can be very influential.

""There is increasing activity among large pension funds, who are engaging with corporate Australia in a constructive way,"" Barry says. ""Over time there's a meaningful return dividend.""

Divestment also comes with risks. Some coal prices doubled in 2016 - so investors who dumped coal stocks at their lows have missed out on that rally.

""Excluding fossil fuels altogether can lead to quite significant variations in returns relative to a broader benchmark,"" Barry says.

One of the largest for-profit fund managers in the country, AMP Capital, is also conducting an audit of  risks across its entire $64 billion in equity funds under management. The findings, which include overseas and some managed externally, will be released later this year.

AMP's Woods also emphasises that the global push from the G20 gives big fund managers such as AMP the chance to have ""a more focused discussion"" with the companies they invest in.

When someone as powerful as the Bank of England's governor is talking about climate risks, he says ""it gives the discussions we have with companies much greater weight"".

It is hard not to contrast this momentum with domestic politics, where the government led by Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, once a keen advocate for a price on carbon, last year abandoned plans to consider an emissions intensity scheme, a type of carbon price.

But government policy is only one influence on how large corporations respond to a threat as complex as .

Clancy Yeates,Australia,"July 11, 2017",Business,"Sydney Morning Herald, The (Australia) ","A third of Australia's biggest listed companies are keeping investors in the dark about how they are managing the potentially large financial risks of , a survey has found.
Despite mounting pressure for companies to assess the business impacts of  and policies to contain global warming, the Australian Council for Superannuation Investors (ACSI) says 70 firms on the ASX 200 index did not make any climate-related disclosures in 2016.

The finding comes after a powerful business taskforce reporting to the G20 last month called for sweeping changes to how much information big companies should give investors about their  exposure, and how they manage these risks.

ACSI has not identified the 70 businesses, as this is the first year it has conducted the survey, and exactly what is expected of companies in this area is still evolving.

Even so, ACSI chief executive Louise Davidson called for a ""rapid"" change to how much of corporate Australia reports on climate risks, and indicated it might name and shame businesses in future.

""It was disappointing to see that such a high number of companies did not make any climate-related exposure,"" Ms Davidson said.

""I find it almost impossible to believe that all 70 of them have no significant exposures.""

For its assessment, ACSI assessed whether ASX200 companies were reporting greenhouse gas emissions, whether they had a carbon emissions target, and whether they had a climate policy.

It did not assess how well placed the firms were to deal with , or technological shifts away from fossil fuels.

It found energy firms were most likely to disclose their emissions, followed by banks. These are two sectors where investors believe significant carbon risks may lie.

However,only a third of the materials sector (miners) had carbon emissions reduction targets, and about a fifth of the energy sector had a target for cutting emissions.

The sectors with the worst record of climate disclosure included businesses in consumer services and telecommunications. A growing number of high-profile regulators, including Bank of England governor Mark Carney, have in recent years warned of the risks of financial dislocation created by ""stranded assets"" that are affected by .

The concern is that firms such as banks and insurance companies could have big exposures to such assets.

Mr Carney has also argued that financial markets need to know about firms' climate strategies so they can allocate capital to those businesses in the best position to profit from the opportunities thrown up by .

A taskforce on climate-related financial disclosures, established under the G20 last month, recommended companies disclose their strategies setting out how they would be affected if global warming could be limited to an increase of no more than 2 degrees.

Domestically, the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority said in February it viewed  as a ""material"" risk that it would be watching more closely in its monitoring of banks, insurance companies, and wealth managers.

ACSI, which represents not-for-profit superannuation funds managing $450 billion, said the lack of reporting on business risks from  was a serious issue for long-term investors.

""As investors, we want to know companies have identified the risks important to them, and understand that they are managing them appropriately,"" Ms Davidson said.",Silence of big companies 'disappointing' - Climate risks - Investors 'kept in dark'
Julien Vincent - Julien Vincent is executive director of Market Forces,Australia,"May 4, 2017",Business,"Sydney Morning Herald, The (Australia) ","Thursday will be a major test of whether the fossil fuel industry is prepared to disclose the risks , including action to reduce emissions, poses to its business.
More importantly, it will be the first test of whether investors, who have been lauding the importance of climate risk disclosure, are prepared to put their money where their mouths are.

Of course, as many of those investors are superannuation funds, invested on behalf of their members, we'll see whether they're prepared to stick their necks out.

A resolution on the agenda of Santos' AGM proposes that the company implement the recommendations of the Financial Stability Board's Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). The TCFD, initiated by Bank of England governor Mark Carney and chaired by Michael Bloomberg, is supported by companies such as BHP Billiton and Unilever, and financial institutions responsible for assets of $US20 trillion ($26.6 trillion).

In December it released a draft set of recommendations for how companies and investors should disclose a whole manner of climate risks to their business.

Risks fall into two main categories. ""Physical risks"" include the impacts of  such as extreme weather, altered rainfall patterns and sea-level rise, and ""transition risks"" include policy and market changes that are inevitable if we are to maintain a habitable climate.

The principle is compelling. If we're going to meet the goals of the Paris  agreement and hold global warming well below two degrees, a rapid decarbonisation of the economy will be required. Asking coal, oil and gas companies to explain how they plan to be compatible with that is a fair enough question.

The trouble is moving beyond the obvious need for greater disclosure, to investors actually insisting the TCFD recommendations be implemented. Despite institutional investors and many superannuation funds telling us that engagement is a far better form of action than divesting from a company, their efforts to convince companies to improve disclosure of climate-related risks have been largely unsuccessful. Currently, just two ASX companies disclose analyses of their performance under a scenario where  is kept below two degrees - AGL Energy and BHP Billiton. And we can critique the robustness of those analyses on another day.

Why Santos? It's one of Australia's largest pure-play fossil fuel companies and in many ways going backwards on disclosure after deciding to not even produce a sustainability report this year. Santos doesn't disclose  mitigation scenario analysis, it doesn't have targets to reduce emissions, and its discussion of climate-related risks is severely limited. Late last year, investors specifically asked Santos to improve its disclosure, yet it has delivered nothing.

Well, I say ""nothing"". With the resolution looming, Santos made an eleventh-hour attempt to placate investors, producing a four-page statement on  disclosure where it commits to ""review"", rather than implement, the TCFD recommendations. It will also produce a  report, even though no terms of reference for the report are offered, let alone a commitment to test the company's resilience to a scenario where the global economy decarbonises to meet the Paris agreement's goals.

Whether or not Santos has been successful in convincing investors to lay off remains to be seen, but it would say a lot about investors who talk a good game on climate risk disclosure if they backed down in the face of such a feeble response.

Whatever the result of Thursday's AGM, we will at least have some answers. We will see whether, when it comes to the crunch, investors are genuinely prepared to back action that mandates  risk disclosure.

Investors have a large influence on the economy. They determine which companies are worthy of investment, who gets to direct those companies and, when necessary, how those companies are managed.

Financial institutions enjoy a great deal of wealth and power without a requisite level of accountability and responsibility. That needs to change. Like it or not, investors are in a position of influence over whether our economy remains stable.

On issues like , we need everyone pulling together, doing what they can to steer us away from a point of no return.

Cole Latimer,Australia,"November 10, 2017",Business,"Sydney Morning Herald, The (Australia) ","Deutsche Bank has developed a tool to forecast where its investments across the globe may be impacted by natural disasters brought on by .
Although tools have existed in the insurance industry to model the impact of , this is the first time this sort of data has been systematically applied to investments.

Deutsche Asset Management created the map with  intelligence firm Four Twenty Seven, covering more than one million individual locations in order to see how changes to climate will threaten its investment portfolios. The group currently has about ¢æ711 billion ($1.06 trillion) under management.

Economic modelling estimates that if carbon emissions aren't reduced throughout this century, per capita GDP will decrease by 23 per cent from what it otherwise would be.

""The effects of  will be ubiquitous but uneven, ranging from those that disrupt daily life, such as damaged or flooded infrastructure, to more gradual impacts like declines in labour productivity and widespread threats to global welfare through decreased crop yields,"" Four Twenty Seven stated.

Deutsche Bank said the development of this tool meant that exposure to catastrophic events for individual companies can now be calculated.

""It tackles physical risk head-on, giving credible insight into the vulnerability of corporate production and retail sites to . Factors such as sea level rise, droughts, flooding and cyclones pose an immediate and measurable threat to investment portfolios,"" Deutsche Bank Asset Management said.

These issues have already been seen in Australia, where heatwaves have caused spikes in power prices, directly impacting business operating costs.

Energy price shocks are the No. 1 concern for Australian businesses, according to a global survey.

The World Economic Forum Global Risks 2018 report, published by Zurich Insurance Group and Marsh and McLennan companies, surveyed more than 12,400 executives from 136 countries, and put energy pricing as the leading concern for businesses operating in Australia within the next 10 years.

Clancy Yeates,Australia,"April 26, 2017",Business,"Sydney Morning Herald, The (Australia) ","Australian retirement savings could be put at risk unless regulators force the financial sector to be more transparent in managing the investment risks created by .
That is is the view of former Liberal leader John Hewson, who is calling for regulators to take a much tougher line on how the financial sector handles the risks associated with global warming.

Dr Hewson, chair of the Asset Owners Disclosure Project, made the call as new rankings showed many of the world's 500 largest asset owners, including some of Australia's biggest superannuation funds, were taking a more active approach to protecting their portfolios from  risks.

Even so, the AODP's annual rankings still labelled many financial giants as ""bystanders"" in their response to climate risks, and Dr Hewson said mandatory disclosure of climate risks was needed to prevent an ""Australian train wreck"".

Because of the country's high carbon intensity at a time when vital trade partner China is also trying to shift towards renewable energy, he argued Australia was particularly exposed to ""systemic financial risk"" caused by .

""With the Australian government missing in action, the RBA, APRA and ASIC must drive change in fund and company reporting. Failure to do so may cost us our retirement savings,"" Dr Hewson said.

The AODP, a not-for-profit body, is part of a growing international push among investors and regulators for greater action to avoid the risks of a ""carbon bubble"". Much of this activity is focused on greater disclosure, in the belief more information would allow markets to ""price in"" the risks created by .

The survey by the AODP said there had been a 19 per cent increase in the number of pension funds, insurance companies and sovereign wealth funds that were taking action in response to . Yet there were still 201 asset owners that were ignoring climate risk, and 187 judged ""bystanders"" - those taking only the first steps in acknowledging these risks. Australian funds were ranked among global leaders, with the Local Government Super fund reclaiming the top position, First State Super in third place, and Australian Super ranked 18th.

For the first time, the survey also ranked the world's 50 largest asset management businesses.

The only Australian manager included in this list was Macquarie Group, which the AODP report gave a D or ""bystander"" rating on its management of  risks, partly because the bank did not complete its survey.

Macquarie said it ""rejects any suggestion it does not recognise the financial risks of "", pointing to its disclosure of carbon exposure, and its large investments in renewable energy.

""As a significant global asset manager, Macquarie is fully committed to ensuring environmental risks are identified and managed responsibly in our business activities and relationships, and each member of staff shares the responsibility for identifying and managing these risks as part of normal business practice,"" a Macquarie spokeswoman said.

Judith Ireland,Australia,"June 15, 2017",Opinion,"Sydney Morning Herald, The (Australia) ","We are in the middle of a cappuccino-led transformation.
The ABC's War on Waste program has recently drawn Australians' attention to the fact that disposable coffee cups are not recyclable. And that one billion of the things go to landfill and litter each year.

So, appropriately horrified, environmentally conscious coffee drinkers are doing something about it. I've noticed a change in the line-up at the coffee stall near my office in recent weeks.

The people who bring their own brightly coloured, plastic cups are starting to outnumber those who stump for the evil, non-recyclable paper kind. Earlier this month, KeepCup - a company that sells reusable coffee cups - was reporting a 400 per cent increase in online sales.

There is a direct relationship here between knowledge and action. It showsa large chunk of us really care about the impact we have on our world.

But when it comes to other, more existential environmental issues, there is a frightening disconnect.

The  debate has hung around federal politics for 10 years now, tying leaders and party rooms in knots and getting us nowhere. And as Federal Parliament once more (with feeling) tackles these issues in the wake of the Finkel Review into the national electricity market, there is a deafening silence about how it relates to the environment.

The rhetoric from the Turnbull government is focused on household electricity prices and energy reliability. The closest Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull and Environment and Energy Minister Josh Frydenberg get to talking about the pressing environmental need to fix our energy supply is sterile references to ""emissions reduction"" and ""international targets"".

Labor is also focusing on power prices, while seizing on Coalition divisions over Finkel's proposed clean energy target. The media is focused on whether Turnbull's leadership will survive trying to implement something less ambitious than John Howard's plans a decade ago.

Meanwhile, Tony Abbott speaks of the need to protect coal as if it is a rare and precious breed of dolphin, not something that actively pollutes the planet.

The federal Department of Environment and Energy's website says the climate is changing due to the burning of fossil fuels, which has led to ice melting and sea levels rising, influenced rainfall and wind patterns and made the ocean more acidic. It adds that scientists agree the ""worst effects"" can be ""largely avoided"" if carbon dioxide emissions are reduced.

Australians also largely agree  is real. According to the Ipsos 2016  Report, 81 per cent of the 1000-plus Australians surveyed agree  is at least partly caused by human activity, while 58 per cent say the ""burning of fossil fuels"" is a top cause of . More than half say  is destroying the Great Barrier Reef and causing more frequent and extreme floods, storms, droughts and bushfires. Almost 60 per cent say Australia should be ""doing more"" about the problem.

But there is not even a puff about this in Canberra. Indeed, there is huge concern about whether our children and grandchildren will be able to buy a house. But not whether said house will be under water or impossible to insure because of the frequency of extreme weather events.

Perhaps this is because while people are worried about , it is not front and centre of their minds or votes.

Ipsos research director Stuart Clark says  peaked in 2007 as a ""top environmental issue for action"" circa Kevin Rudd's ""great moral challenge"", before taking a dive during the global financial crisis. Concern has tracked up since then, but is still below 2007 levels.

""People are concerned about  but the economy is probably equally just as much of a concern,"" Clark says.

Maybe people are also exhausted by the years of angry politicians, doomsday prophecies from both sides of the debate and ultimately no real change. Maybe the big picture is too scary to engage with. And it's easier to just buy a reusable coffee cup and feel you've done your bit.

The Australia Institute's executive director Ben Oquist (a former chief-of-staff to Greens leaders Bob Brown and Christine Milne) adds that while people accept  is real, ""there is a denialism of the significance of it"".

You studied Bachelor of Education but later went for a Master of Environmental Studies,  and Sustainability, which is quite a rare specialisation. What informed this shift?

Basically, passion is what drove me to  work. Kenya is one of the most vulnerable countries in the world owing to the fact that we depend on weather-related resources for sustainability. Our Tourism industry for example is nature based and any change of climate will affect the livelihoods of millions of Kenyans. In a nutshell, seeking alternatives in adaptation and mitigation on how to help our people brought me to the industry.

We have achieved this in a number of ways, for instance, we came up with the  Act that was signed by the president last year. This law has put measures in control of  problems in the country. I have also assisted some counties such as Kitui, Kajiado and Narok in coming up with -related policies. At KCCWG, we believe that the best tool to ensure that we have long lasting change is by ensuring that laws and policy frameworks are in place; this moves us beyond the advocacy period.

For a young person who studied (or is studying) a  related science or is in a related course, how would you advise them to prepare for the job market?

You need to be connected to what you are studying; you need to love what you study and most importantly, join networks or organisations dealing with  so that you get hands-on experience of what you are studying. Green Africa Foundation and Kenya Forest Working Group are examples of such organisations.

How do you draw young people to the organisation?

The Kenya  Working Group is a national CSO membership network and platform comprising civil society actors, faith-based institutions, communities, youth, non-governmental organisations, universities and research institutions striving to create synergies within the  arena through collaborative action.

KCCWG is organised into 10 thematic groups that reflect the major sectors of Kenya¡¯s socio-economic development. These include forestry, gender and conflict over natural resources, energy, water, tourism, Road to conference of Parties among others. A young person with passion can easily find a place within the organisation.

Are there timelines when students and graduates can look out for internships and attachments in your organisation?

We always have interns from various universities and advertise these opportunities in our website and other channels such as social media. Regularly visit www.kccwg.org

Do you think that there is enough awareness about the importance of  at the grassroots?

To a greater extent yes. As an organisation we have held a series of awareness meetings across the country targeting the most affected counties. We have contributed to the various legislations at national and county government level that safeguard the mainstreaming of  issues in policy decisions.

Would you say that environmental conservation is an area that is open to young people?

 is one of the biggest threats faced by our natural world and also a tough social and economic issue.  This is something that we cannot leave for future generations to clean up; we must join hands now and embed climate issues in all our efforts

What are some of the careers that young people taking environmental-related courses can consider?

The careers to consider are so many and varied because some are interlinked with the so called traditional careers, however, to mention a few, we have environmental lawyers, research fellows, climatologists, oceanographers,  experts and analysts.

What was your first job? What are some of your most memorable experiences of it?

I worked in a mining company as a junior officer. The employees in that company came from different countries, and that gave me exposure especially regarding working with people from different cultures. I was later promoted from a junior officer to the level of a General Manager in Rockland Kenya Limited; this move gave me the push to work harder and grow to the level that I am at today.

You were recently appointed by President Uhuru Kenyatta to be a member of the  Council under the  ACT 2016, how do you intend to use this position to the benefit of the youth?

I encourage youth to register  related CBOs, NGOs and faith-based organisations and apply for support from the  Fund, which can support them and help them to achieve  projects.

What is your most memorable experience at university that is non-academic?

ROBERT MUTHAMI,Kenya,"December 18, 2017",NEWS,"Daily Nation (Nairobi, Kenya) ","The country faces significant challenges from the negative impacts of  that could slow down or reverse some of the gains made in the realisation of sustainable development, if not addressed properly.  The economy and the people¡¯s livelihoods are highly dependent on natural resources such as land, water, and forests, but these are highly vulnerable to climate variability and change.  The agricultural sector, which is highly affected by , contributes 26 per cent of the gross domestic product (GDP) and another 27 per cent of the GDP indirectly through linkages with other sectors.  It also employs more than 40 per cent of the total population and 70 per cent of the country¡¯s rural people. DROUGHT With rising temperatures and changing rainfall patterns, Kenyans will continue to witness extreme weather such as drought and floods.  These events are a threat to development and life.  The Constitution sets out legal commitments to attain social, ecological and economic development. It provides a firm basis the national and county governments can use to address the challenge of  while striving to attain the development goals set out in the Kenya Vision 2030.  These should be addressed based on the need for adaptation to the impact of  and the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.  PARIS AGREEMENT Adaptation requires legal and policy provisions, investment in technology, and financial allocations to enable the people, the economy and the environment to continue to function in deteriorating circumstances. Kenya is among the few African countries that have policies and plans to provide an enabling environment to tackle .  It is among the 170 nations that have ratified the Paris Agreement under the United Nations Framework Convention on  (UNFCCC) and has deposited an ambitious  commitment in line with the Paris Agreement through its Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC). Similarly, Kenya has championed its  agenda in negotiations as evidenced in the 23rd Session of the Conference of Parties (COP23) under the UNFCCC held in Bonn, Germany from November 6 to 17.  PROGRESS The meeting was expected to make progress on the development of modalities, procedures, and guidelines for the implementation of various articles under the Paris Agreement dubbed the Paris Work Programme or Paris Rule Book.  In Bonn, the discussions on the Paris rules resulted in draft texts that reflect uneven progress, comparing the outcome achieved on various articles of the Paris Agreement. Much work remains to be done to secure robust Paris rules by COP24 next year and countries will have to intensify their efforts to firm up the rules.  EMISSIONS Once the Paris Rule Book is adopted, Kenya will be required to report on its progress in meeting its adaptation and mitigation ambitions.  It has demonstrated commitment to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 30 per cent by 2030.  It is, therefore, crucial to think through what this means while factoring in the capacity to implement  actions. Ahead of the 24th COP to be held in Katowice, Poland, in 2018, Kenya will have to internalise what its commitment to the Paris Agreement really means to the different sectors of the economy.  Kenya must strengthen  actions, especially at the county level as provided under the  Act of 2016, in the spirit of devolution. Considering the weak considerations and linkage of  in the 2013-2017 County Integrated Development Plans (CIDPs), the NDC can only be realised if  is included in the development agenda at the county level.

A new report by the Food and Agriculture Organisation says that unless action is taken to make agriculture more sustainable, productive and resilient,  will seriously compromise food production in the region. Ironically, industries in the agriculture sector are part of the problem, accounting for 21 per cent of greenhouse gas emissions. East Africa, which is currently being ravaged by drought, is among regions facing the threat of . And the worsening food situation is plunging more people into extreme poverty. ¡°The impact of  on agriculture and the implications for food security are alarming,¡± states the State of Food and Agriculture 2016 report. ¡°There is thus an urgent need to support smallholders in adapting to . ¡°The greatest vulnerabilities are seen in areas of sub-Saharan Africa and South and Southeast Asia, where millions of people are likely to face greater risk of food insecurity as a result of  by the 2050s,¡± the report says. Since agriculture provides a livelihood for almost two-thirds of the world¡¯s extremely poor, or some 750 million people,  impact on agriculture is already ravaging vulnerable rural populations. It is estimated that by 2050, about 50 million more people will be at risk of undernourishment because of . Depending on the  scenario and socio-economic development path, between 34 million and 600 million more people could suffer from hunger by 2080. Threat of hunger To avoid crises like the drought in East Africa, the world must find ways to tackle the threat of hunger, poverty and  together. With  out of the equation, 312 million people globally will be at risk of hunger in the 2050s, and 300 million people in the 2080s. According to the report,  is expected to seriously compromise agriculture¡¯s ability to feed the most vulnerable, thus impeding progress towards the eradication of hunger, malnutrition and poverty. Already the effects of  are being felt in the form of higher temperatures, frequent extreme weather events, water shortages, rising sea levels, ocean acidification, land degradation, the disruption of ecosystems and the loss of biodiversity. For the world to meet the demand for food in 2050, annual production of crops and livestock must increase by 60 per cent compared with production levels in 2006. About 80 per cent of the required increase will need to come from higher yields and 10 per cent from increases in the number of cropping seasons per year. According to the report,  affects food availability through its increasingly adverse impacts on crop yields, fish stocks and animal health and productivity especially in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, where most food insecure people live.

The Paris Agreement, an instrument that enhances the implementation of the UNFCCC to realise global sustainable development and eradicate poverty, became operational in 2015, some five years earlier than expected.

With the due date for the Paris Agreement¡¯s ¡°entry into force¡± occurring before 2020, the rules of the process governing it are being fast-tracked.

The 23rd UN Climate Conference is expected to agree on the rules and processes to implement the agreement referred to as the Paris Rule Book. It is hoped that the rule book will embed openness, transparency, and the inclusiveness of all the categories of stakeholders.

The COP approval of the guiding principles will be crucial, as will Kenya¡¯s participation. Kenya does not have sufficient resources to enable it to tackle . Its ability to continue carrying out its pre-2020 climate activities still requires financial, capacity-building and technology support.

Prior to the Paris Agreement to limit warming to as close as possible to 1.5¡ÆC and no more than 2.0¡ÆC in 2015, Kenya had been undertaking the measures laid out in its National  Action Plan (NCCAP) 2013-2017 to operationalise it National  Response Strategy (NCCRS) 2010.

This was reiterated in its Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) submitted in 2015, which specifies both adaptation and mitigation interventions. It also contributes to sustainable development aspirations as laid out in the Constitution and Vision 2030.

Vision 2030 considers reliable and sufficient energy as a key foundation and enabler.

The Sustainable Environmental Development Watch (Suswatch) embarked on regional and national interventions to contribute to Promoting the Implementation of the Paris Agreement (PIPA) focusing on Pro-poor Low Emission Development.

Working with partners in Tanzania, Uganda and Denmark, the project conducted studies on the implementation of Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs).

It examined their experiences of climate financing from the Green Climate Fund (GCF), and offered ideas on the development of national low emission development strategies (LEDS).

Suswatch participated in the fifth Nile Basin Development Forum from October 23 to 25, in Kigali that deliberated on energy access and water.

On the sidelines of the 23rd UN Climate Conference in Bonn, on November 9, Suswatch will host a side event with its partners.

The rate at which the harmful greenhouse gases (GHGs) are emitted into the atmosphere is worrying. Increased population, industrialisation, globalisation and infrastructural development among other factors have been blamed but we must fight this scourge called .



The gases have completely altered the normal functionality of the atmosphere and these disturbances have consequently leaked many other dysfunctional and devastating effects, direct or indirectly to the atmosphere, to humanity and to the climate.



Indeed, extensive body of scientific research has shown evidence that long and/or short-term exposure to air pollution damage ecosystem, environmental degradation and can lead to premature death and harmful effects to the body system like cardiovascular system respiratory and other health complications.



It is therefore important for a serious government to put measures to mitigate and/or adapt to these  factors that continues to haunt humanity in the 21st century.



Regulatory bodies, legislatures and other climate conscious entities must help the state to meeting standards to common pollutant by issuing national policies and standards on emissions for new and old motor machinery that are high in emitting fossil fuel and carbon that depletes the atmosphere.



Policies and regulations of emissions by individuals, industries and equipment like power plants, cement manufacturers, farmers among other stakeholders must be regulated with strictness and sincerity required.



Air pollution research must be given a priority because newest scientific findings on matters pollutants are key in minimising the effects of greenhouse gas emissions.



Quality air standards must be developed and implement through legislative avenues. Policies e.g. on fine particle pollution, ground level ozone pollution and sulfur dioxide emissions must be reviewed and/or evaluated to suit the current  mitigation and adaptation approaches.



Meanwhile, Africa will continue to experience the sharper edge of  due to her inability to reduce emission of harmful gases into the atmosphere.

It¡¯s time to walk the talk on environmental conservation



In our Science class from primary to high school, we were taught about the effects of pollution and the possible solutions. Depending on where you went to school, it was a mandatory requirement to tend to the school compound.



Planting trees and dropping our waste in dustbins as part of keeping the environment clean was our daily dose of learning.



Where then did we miss the mark in management of pollution? Why is it difficult to dump empty water bottles in bins? Save for the ugliness the plastics spew, it is disgusting to see cattle eating trash strewn on the roads- the very same beef we shall eat with ugali.



When did we become so lazy as to point the finger at the county government, which has presumably hired people to clean up after our mess? We have choked our world we can¡¯t even breath.



The ban on plastic bags has been applauded by top global policy makers who converged on Nairobi for the United Nations Environment Assembly in Gigiri.



The move to ban plastics brought us one step closer to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals that touch on the environment.



I sincerely hope that the conference will offer fool proof conservation measures to last a lifetime. Let us turn our focus to air pollution and global warming.



My wish is that the county governments will walk the talk with conservation and recycling measures.

",LETTER: World must tackle effects of climate change
KADDU KIWE SEBUNYA,Kenya,"November 12, 2017",NEWS,"Sunday Nation (Nairobi, Kenya) ","World leaders and conservation stakeholders are meeting this week in Bonn, Germany, for the annual  conference.
This year¡¯s meeting, known as the 23rd Conference of the Parties (COP23), seeks to negotiate?and outline how to implement the?Paris Agreement on? now signed by all countries except USA. The agreement (adopted in 2015) is an attempt to reduce?greenhouse gas emissions and help poorer countries adapt to the adverse effects of .

HISTORY

You don¡¯t have to go far to see the predicted changing world.?I was in Cape Town last week and the city is experiencing its worst water crisis in recent history.

Kenya is smarting from drought and related cattle and wildlife conflicts. Lake Chad is shrinking, the Sahara Desert is expanding south.

The continent has just emerged from the?worst drought in 60 years in regions like the Horn of Africa.?

Perhaps more than for any other continent,  is a big security and existential threat for Africa. In the?Sahel,?the collapse of agriculture in some areas in the face of extreme dry weather has been blamed for sending young people into the hands of terror groups.

The adverse climate changes that have decimated livestock in West Africa and the Horn have driven thousands of Africans who are no longer able to make a living on the land on dangerous?journeys to cross the oceans and seas to Europe.

POPULATION

This scenario is likely to worsen if we look at?Africa¡¯s huge population increase. Statistics show that 3.5 million people are born in Africa monthly ? or 80 people every minute, meaning that Africa¡¯s new-borns are enough to fill the whole of London every three months.

By 2050, Africans will constitute 54 per cent of the global human population, and 82 per cent by 2100. Many of these are likely to emigrate to European and American metropolises, pushed there by inclement climate in Africa.

A recent joint publication of the United Nations Executive Office of the Secretary-General and the United Nations Framework Convention on  notes that  threatens to reverse the gains in global fight against poverty, hunger, and disease, besides ruining lives and livelihoods of millions of people in the Global South, especially in Africa.

As a continent that has suffered from, and continues to grapple with some of the worst global warming impacts, Africa will be keenly awaiting the outcome of the conference whilst hoping that it yields effective solutions.

Agriculture, which is the backbone of the continent¡¯s economy and a source of employment for over 70 per cent of the population in countries like Kenya, has over the years borne the brunt of extreme weather conditions exacerbated by .

CONFLICT

As viable land for growing crops and grazing animals continue to decrease rapidly as a result of global warming, affected communities ? driven by desperation to survive at whatever cost ? are forcefully invading neighbouring lands or newer territories considered fertile thus driving inter-communal land conflicts.

Similarly, there has been an increase in the number of people encroaching on forests and destroying this ecosystem that is significant for the sustainability of water reserves.

Encroachment into game reserves has also increased human-wildlife conflict which is a threat to game animals that enhance the performance of the tourism sector ? a major foreign exchange earner for many countries.

As the population increases and global warming effects bite, people will continue to put pressure on an environment that is already reeling from the adverse effects of .

This will stretch it to the limits hence leading to grave food insecurity challenges.

Youth unemployment rate is now at a high of over 40 per cent in Kenya and Ethiopia, 45 per cent in Nigeria, as the number of job seekers on the continent outstrips job creation.

GROWTH

Previously, the agricultural sector would provide self-employment opportunities for a majority of these jobless young people. But this is becoming increasingly difficult with erratic weather and decreasing land sizes fuelled by population growth.

If solutions to these problems remain elusive, experts predict that African countries will suffer from a bulging unemployed youthful population that will be a burden to economies in sub-Saharan Africa.

Instead of contributing valuable human resource to boost economic growth, they are likely to turn to crime and other social vices to enable them earn their livelihoods.

It is for this reason that African governments are hoping that the conference will yield practical strategies, especially financial assistance, to enable them to effectively implement  adaptation solutions.

Some of the proposed solutions include a shift from rain-fed agriculture, which will require African governments to invest in irrigation schemes that offer sustainable water supply to farmers and boost crop yields.

 and variability are considered major threats to sustainable progress. Experts say that the areas likely to feel the greatest impacts are the economy, water resources, ecosystems, food security, coastal zones, health, population and settlements.

It is projected that average temperatures in Kenya will increase by between 1¡Æ and 3¡Æ Celsius by 2050, yet an increase in temperature by more than 1¡Æ Celsius might aggravate the attendant aridity, especially in low-lying areas. If that happens,? conflicts over resources are likely to escalate.

 FUND

Data from the Kenya?Metrological Department (KMD) indicate that?pastoral livelihoods are at risk from rising surface temperatures, more intense rainfall and more frequent droughts.

¡°There has been a slight decline in rainfall in Lodwar in Turkana County, where the mean rainfall decreased by 13 mm between the first 23 years recorded (1950-1973) and the last 41 years (1974-2015). The frequency and severity of droughts have increased in recent decades, with episodes of moderate to severe drought occurring more frequently since the 1980s,¡± the KMD report says.?

However, Mr Jarso says there is hope for pastoralists living in Asals since the passing of the Kenya  Act of 2016 creates an enabling environment for them to access climate financing.

¡°In Kenya, Wajir and Makueni counties were the first to enact the County  Fund (CCCF) legislation, with Isiolo, Garissa, and Kitui at advanced stages of approving theirs, which are anchored to the Kenya  Act,¡± adds Mr Jarso.

The CCCF Act? allows counties to access  finance from their own budgets, as well as from national and international sources.

Miriam Naramat, a 25-year-old mother of three, is one of the beneficiaries of the CCCF fund, which has brought water close to her Nantundu Village in Isiolo North.??She no longer has to walk long distances in search of water since the Count  Fund seed money from the UK government¡¯s Department for International Development (DfID) has enabled the fencing and?piping of water to kiosks and troughs from the water pan.

Pastoralists living in the nearby villages of Lengiteng, Ntumodet, Looseketet, Langaaman and Lmesheni have also benefited. This, is one way of helping herders in the north tackle .

CCCF legislation commits counties to devote a certain percentage of their development budget to building community resilience, empowering residents through their elected ward adaptation planning committees (WAPCs) to set priorities on how 70 per cent of the funds set aside for adaptation will be used.

TRADITIONAL SYSTEMS

The approach, piloted in Isiolo and being replicated in Makueni, Garissa, Kitui and Wajir, uses funds from (DfID).

?In Isiolo, the fund has helped the communities invest in infrastructure such as sand dams to trap rainwater, providing clean and reliable water during dry periods.

The fund has also helped strengthen customary resource management institutions, such as ¡°dedhas¡± among the Borana, to manage the resources currently the source of conflict between the Borana and neighbouring pastoralist counties.

?¡°The County  Fund in Isiolo also strengthened the traditional systems that govern the natural resources in rangelands. The strengthened traditional grazing governance institution (dhedha elders) subdivided land into grazing zones (namely wet dry season areas, as well as a? and drought reserve area)¡±, says Lordman Lekalkuli, the Isiolo County drought coordinator.

He says the management of the designated grazing zones makes Isiolo better off than its neighbours, enabling it to accommodate pastoralists from other counties in when it is extremely dry.?

¡°For instance, in Merti, the Yamicha water pan was put off limits, thanks to a resolution by dedha elders to prevent access to pasture in the reserve before the stipulated time.¡±

Managed well, the Congo Basin can produce cheap and clean hydropower for the continent, support life and agriculture, and keep people from cutting down trees for energy. The mobile telecommunications revolution in Africa has taught us that with a little imagination, enlightened policies and political will the continent can leapfrog across technological chasms that divide it from the rest of the world. We must now apply the same ingenuity and determination to create economic opportunity without destroying our environmental and ecological heritage. In many cases the damage has already been done and Africa, like the rest of the world, is running out of time.

Ever since their cooperative, Huruma Asili, began receiving daily weather updates via mobile phone a year ago, fewer of their sliced mangoes turn an unsellable shade of black when laid out to dry.
The service sprang not from a one-size-fits-all template drawn up by a government ministry or a far-flung aid agency, but from the women's own considered response to a simple question posed by their peers to the whole neighbourhood: 'What do you need to lessen the harm of ?'
It's a bottom-up approach that underpins fledgling local adaptation initiatives in Kenya, one of the largest recipients of climate finance in sub-Saharan Africa.

A few overcast hours are enough to lower the temperature and raise the humidity in their plastic-covered drying sheds to the point where ruinous putrefaction overtakes value-adding desiccation.
Properly cured, the bright yellow mangoes are sold for Sh500 per kilo to a Japanese exporter based in Nairobi. If discoloured, the fruit is worthless and has to be discarded.
'When the ward committee asked us what we wanted, we told them: Accurate information on the weather so that we know when to dry our mangoes,' said Rehema Madaga, whose association, set up in Makueni county in 2006, also sells dried pumpkins, a variety of vegetables and chickpeas.
Every afternoon now, the Kenya Meteorological Department sends the women a very localised weather forecast in a text message to their mobile phones.
'This has helped us stop losses due to blackening of the mangoes when we dried them and then the weather turned cloudy or rainy,' explained Madaga.
In several counties nationwide, neighbourhood  planning committees made up of ward residents are working on the front lines of adaptation to , from initial project conception, through execution, to evaluation and financial oversight.
Unlocking finance
Makueni is one of five counties in Kenya's arid and semi-arid regions where the financing of  adaptation projects by local rather than national administrations is being piloted.
The aim is that these local governments'  funds will evolve into what, in the jargon of international climate finance, are termed subnational 'implementing/executing entities', a status that allows them to tap into national and international funding pots, which have strict conditions for disbursements.
These will include the Green Climate Fund, which, when running at full capacity by 2,020, will have around Sh10 trillion to spend every year, half of it on adaptation projects (some Sh1 trillion has already been pledged to the fund).
Currently, funding in the five pilot counties comes from the UK's Department for International Development and is channelled through an adaptation consortium made up of government bodies and various local and international NGOs.
By the end of 2017, the consortium, which also helps counties set up their  funds, estimates that some 2.5 million Kenyans will have benefited from adaptation projects.
In Makueni, nine projects were carried out in six of the county's 30 wards last year. This year, all wards are expected to benefit and the county has set aside about Sh60,000,000.

News,Kenya,"October 27, 2017",News,"Star, The (Nairobi, Kenya) ","A stable climate is a vital foundation for all life on Earth. With the majority of the Kenyan population engaging in a daily struggle to make a living, it can be difficult to find time to think about some of the bigger issues of our age; and they do not come bigger than  and sustainability of our environment.
If we continue to act as we are currently, then climate modelling predicts a two to five degree Celsius increase in ambient temperature by 2050. The projected impact of this higher climate range is devastating. We often think that this will be in the future, however, it has already begun. We are seeing more extreme weather events, such as the recent hurricanes in the US, wildfires in Portugal and the drought here in Kenya.
Kenya has been vulnerable to direct and indirect impacts of . We now face more erratic weather, hotter temperatures, unpredictable rainfall, increased incidences of drought and floods, and more pests and diseases, such as the recent cholera outbreak.
This vulnerability is aggravated by the fact that a greater proportion of the population has livelihoods that depend on climate-sensitive economic production, such as rain-fed agriculture.
Whilst the government is faced with needs, such as those associated with poverty alleviation and economic growth, there is an even more urgent need to incorporate long-term thinking about climate risks into existing planning decisions and policy processes. Policymakers should ascertain that 2017 is the last year that drought is declared a national disaster.
There are two broad strategies that can be adopted. First is adaptation. This aims to develop strategies to cope with the effects of . Where the economy is concerned,  not only poses risks, it also presents significant opportunities.
Such opportunities arise from the need for innovation in resilient materials and services, new weather and climate analytics, climate-resistant seeds, crops, and farming methods. It opens up many avenues for industry to develop low-emission, more climate-friendly technologies. It provides opportunities for insurers to develop new insurance products as an incentive to pursue resilience.
The second strategy is mitigation. This aims to minimise the impact of  by decreasing the production of greenhouse gases and other pollutants. The business sector comprising investors, banks and other financial service providers would play a significant role in mitigation through three ways.
These include: Increasing finance flows into low-carbon energy and climate-resilient infrastructure; decreasing the flow of finance to carbon-intensive and obsolete technologies and business practices; and collaborating with regulators to ensure that rules that govern financial markets are conducive to sustainable development.
Some of the individual actions you can take to help tackle  include: saving energy by switching off and unplugging appliances when not in use, using energy-efficient lighting, buying energy-efficient appliances, choosing climate-friendly transportation such as walking or riding your bike, car sharing and using public transport, among others.

EUNICE KILONZO,Kenya,"June 2, 2017",NEWS,"Daily Nation (Nairobi, Kenya) ","African climate activists have called on the rest of the world to ""hold historic emitters like the US under the watch of Donald Trump to account"", hours after President Trump withdrew his country from the 2015 Paris Agreement on .
The accord, signed on December 13 in Le Bourget, France, by 197 countries and ratified by 147, aims to curb global greenhouse gas emissions by preventing global temperatures from rising by more than two degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, and also to keep the increase to less than 1.5 degrees to contain the effects of .

CLIMATE CRISIS

It was to come into effect in 2020. However, Mr Trump said the deal instead would damage US economic prospects.

He said if Washington secures a better deal, it may try to rejoin the pact.

The Pan-African Climate Justice Alliance (PACJA) says that as a result of the pulling out of the US, people power and international solidarity are the only hope to fight off the climate crisis.

PACJA Secretary-General Mithika Mwenda says the quest for a better environment will not be tossed aside.

""It will take all of us around the world, organising together, to ensure our governments also do their fair share of climate action in the next four years to keep global warming below 1.5 degrees. Trump's decision doesn't change that,"" he said.

MONEY PLEDGED

This is because the United States, under then President Barack Obama, pledged to cut domestic greenhouse gas emissions by 26 per cent by 2025, and committed up to $3 billion in aid to poorer countries by 2020 to help them adjust to the effects of .

So far, $1 billion has been dispatched.

Wealthy nations agreed to provide $100 billion annually to enable developing nations to move away from fossil fuels and use more renewable energy sources.

The healthier alternative would create more jobs and reduce the dependence on fossil fuels, which pollute the environment.

FIGHTING GLOBAL WARMING

The US withdrawal will likely weaken the global efforts in addressing , particularly because other countries may relax their efforts to curb greenhouse gases.

According to The New York Times, developing countries like India, Indonesia and the Philippines ""might be more reluctant to tackle their emissions if the United States pulled back on promised aid to help them adjust to the worst effects of "".

Despite the US action, according to The Times, leaders in Europe, China and India have insisted that they would continue addressing global warming. But the ""precise shape of future climate talks remains an open question"".

LOCAL CHAMPIONS

More importantly, the article indicates that California and New York intend to carry on with their own programmes to ""clean up power plants and vehicles.

""And the private sector is already shifting towards cleaner energy: cheap natural gas and renewables will continue to drive the retirement of coal plants,"" the newspaper said

Nonetheless, the Trump-led nation ""would be doing far less about global warming than it otherwise might have done"".

This is because, it says, an examination by the Rhodium Group, which analyses disruptive worldwide trends, approximated that, under President Trump¡¯s policies, ""United States emissions will now most likely fall 15 to 19 per cent below 2005 levels by 2025, rather than the 26 to 28 per cent that the Obama administration pledged"".

INCREASE EFFORTS

During the Conference of Parties 21 (COP21), that is the 2015 United Nations  Conference, African countries demanded compensation for the effects of the menace, ranging from desertification to forest degradation.

Erik Solheim, executive director of the United Nations Environment Programme, said the US decision does not ""bring an end to this unstoppable effort"".

""There is incredible momentum on climate action from individual states, cities, the private sector and citizens.

""A single political decision will not derail this unparalleled effort. UN Environment urges all parties to redouble their efforts. We will work with everyone willing to make a difference,"" he said.

Solheim added that the Paris Agreement is founded on clear evidence, solid science and incredible international collaboration.

""It will put aside differences to tackle a common, monumental challenge. The reversal of damage to the ozone layer proves that such a global effort can succeed.

""Ultimately, this is an investment in our own survival that no-one can afford to abandon.""",Countries to soldier on with war on global warming
NEWS,Kenya,"December 7, 2017",NEWS,"Daily Nation (Nairobi, Kenya) ","The 2017 United Nations Environment Assembly (UNEA) has been taking place in Kenya this week.
The theme of the conference was ¡®Towards a Pollution-Free Planet¡¯.?

The high-level global forum came at a time when air pollution levels are at their highest. There is an urgent need to stop politicising  and get serious about implementing?mitigative?and adaptive measures.

 is a global issue that calls for global solutions.

Although the UN¡¯s initiatives to clean air through UN Framework Conventions on  Kyoto Protocol (1997), 2015 Paris Agreement and the recent Bonn Conference have been impressive, a lot needs to be done.

The rate at which harmful greenhouse gases are being emitted into the atmosphere is worrying.

Increased population, industrialisation, globalisation and infrastructural development, among other factors, have been blamed but we must now take serious action to fight .

The gases have completely altered the normal functionality of the atmosphere and these disturbances have devastating effects on humanity and climate.

Indeed, research shows that exposure to air pollution damages the ecosystem and can lead to premature deaths and harmful effects to the body system ? such as cardiovascular, respiratory and other health complications.

It is, therefore, important for a serious government to put measures to mitigate and/or adapt to these  factors. Regulatory bodies, legislatures and other climate-conscious entities must help the State to achieve this goal.

Policies and regulations of emissions by individuals, industries and equipment such as power plants, cement manufacturers and farmers, among other stakeholders, must be regulated with strictness.?

Air pollution research must be given priority because new scientific findings on matters pollutants are key in minimising the effects of greenhouse gas emissions.

Quality air standards must be developed and implemented through legislation.

If that is not the case, Africa will continue to experience the sharper edge of  due to its inability to reduce emission of harmful gases into the atmosphere.

In a recent submission to a parliamentary committee, the agriculture ministry said productivity decrease of major crops would be marginal in the next few years but could rise to as much as 10-40% by 2100 unless farming adapts to -induced changes in weather. Wheat, rice, oilseeds, pulses, fruits and vegetables will see reduced yields over the years, forcing farmers to either adapt to challenges of  or face the risk of getting poorer. Adaptation will need different cropping patterns and suitable inputs to compensate yield fluctuations. The challenge is particularly urgent for Indian agriculture where productivity for crops like rice does not compare even with neighbours like China. The possibility of a further dip due to  will be particularly worrying as it could turn India into a major importer of oilseeds, pulses and even milk. By 2030, it may need 70 million tonnes more of foodgrains than the expected production in 2016-17. The economic survey, in its latest mid-year report, says ""estimates indicate that currently India incurs losses of about $ 9-10 billion annually due to extreme weather events. Of these, nearly 80% losses remain uninsured"". It pointed out that 2014 floods in Kashmir cost more than $ 15 billion and Cyclone Hudhud the same year cost $ 11 billion. The quantum of loss will increase substantially in future if one takes into account the impact of  on farm productivity. Extreme weather events are not always linked to  but research shows that their frequency and severity is increasing and this is being increasingly read as a fallout of . The ministry, in its submission, noted that though most crops will see reduced production in a `business as usual' scenario,  may help improve yields of soyabean, chickpea, groundnut, coconut (in western coast) and potato (in Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh). Potato production will, however, decline in rest of India, particularly in West Bengal and southern plateau region. The ministry also noted possible decrease in yields of certain crops in traditional sown areas but an increase elsewhere due to change in weather pattern. It also observed that increasing food demand due to an increasing population, expanding urbanisation and rising income may require India to depend on import if it does not act on time to increase production and productivity of major food crops, pulses, oilseeds and milk by adapting to .""Vulnerability of Indian agriculture due to vagaries associated with  and low adaptation capacity of majority of Indian farmers poses risk to food security of the country"", said the Parliamentary Standing Committee on agriculture while referring to various submissions made before it by different ministries. The report of the panel was tabled in the Parliament during the Monsoon session.""If the country, which is more or less self-sufficient in foodgrain production, moves on with the business as usual approach, it will have to suffer a major loss due to rising temperature and uneven distribution of rainfall. If all the losses are compounded, India will be a major victim of "", said an ICAR official, citing the projection made by the public sector agricultural research institution. The ICAR-National Institute of Agricultural Economics and Policy Research has projected food demand of 345 million tonnes (MT) by 2030 - almost 30% higher than in 2011. Referring to its projected demands for fruits, vegetables, milk, animal products (meat, eggs and fish), sugar and edible oil, the panel said the demand for these products by 2030 is estimated to be 2-3 times more than that in 2011. Though foodgrain production has increased from 259.29 MT in 2011-12 to 275.68 MT (estimated) in 2016-17, the country still needs to take multiple measures to match the projected demand of foodgrain by 2030.

They admitted that they were experiencing the aftermath of , but were ignorant of contributory factors and impacts. According to them, the depletion of fish resources, occur rence of extreme events, loss in fishing days, overtargeted fishing happened after .""We found that they understood the changes in temperatures, fish catch dwindling and that it was impacting their lives. However, they didn't know that it was a larger issue that needs to be addressed,"" he said. Southwest India was recognized as one of the 24 global hotspot regions that are vulnerable to .  hotspots are defined as the `live labs' where the manifestation of  impacts are observed first. Initially, 198 indicators were identified in the construction of vulnerability indices of which 37, were related to sensitivity, 36 to exposure and rest dealt with adaptive capacity . The four-year project that began in 2014 looked at the low-level of awareness on  among fishermen in Kerala owing to the fact that such change issues were entangled with other developmental issues; thereby the community could not decipher them. Though there were many studies done on this topic, the scientific knowledge generated hasn't trickled down to the grass roots. It was re ported reported natural calami ties like sea in trusion, storms, and shoreline changes were c o m m o n a t Poonthura and houses were constructed near the sea. The shoreline changes and sea water intrusion were the visible impacts of . According to the respondents, relocations are necessary during monsoon. In Elamkunnapuzha, it was observed that the basement of most houses had sunk a few feet into the earth and hence water stagnation was observed in the surrounding areas, even inside the house compound. In order to rectify this problem, many households relocated to safer areas. Researchers said that the study will develop a framework for all tropical countries that have coastal communities. ""CMFRI will work with panchayats so that women, youth, children and experienced fishermen become the  champions to create awareness and develop other livelihood options. Later, local bodies can incorporate adaptation and mitigation in their development plans,"" he said. The results will form the basis for a framework for all coastal communities in tropical countries.

Karthikeyan Hemalatha,India,"June 5, 2017",Chennai,"Times of India, The (Mumbai, India) ","Recently, the world received a rude shock when US president Donald Trump, pulled out of the Paris climate accord. Trump might nurture his belief that  is a Chinese hoax, but alas, it is not the case because the world has begun facing the brunt of this environmental crisis. Closer home, a stark example is Chennai, which in the past two years has seen a drought, a flood, heavy rains, and winds of epic proportion. The city is witnessing all symptoms of , say scientists and meteorologists. And as the city gets hotter, it is also getting wetter. Chennai received excessive monsoon rainfall between 2004 and 2011 - with some years recording more than 60% of normal rainfall. ""This is an unprecedented record, since the weather recording began in 1870,"" says retired deputy director general of India Meteorological Department (IMD) Y E A Raj. ""It's time we studied the effects of urbanisation and its impacts on our climate,"" he adds. The burning of coal, diesel and petrol increases carbon level in the atmosphere, which in turn raises the temperature of the sea surface, say scientists. ""Increase in carbon emission is directly responsible for the increase in sea surface temperature. While land reflects the heat, the sea absorbs it. When more carbon is released to the atmosphere, the sea traps more heat,"" says professor A Ramachandran, Anna University's Centre for  and Adaptation Research. Rise in sea surface temperature leads to accumulation of more moisture above the sea - the source for monsoon clouds. Chennai is the only city to receive 80% of its annual rainfall from the northeast monsoon, which is short and powerful. ""With the increase in sea surface temperature, rains in October, November and December are going to get more and more unpredictable. Rainfall that is spread over 50 days can be expected to pour down in four to 10 days. This could be a reality in 20 years,"" says Ramachandran. Based on weather data collected between 1960 and 2000, the research centre predicts that Chennai's climate will become more unpredictable and aggressive over the coming years. Data from India Meteorological Department shows a drastic increase in the number of days during which the maximum temperature crossed 40?C. While there were only three days in 1990 that breached the 40?C mark, it shot to 38 in 2012. ""What is more worrisome is that even night time temperatures are increasing,"" says Ramachandran. A report in Tamil Nadu State Action Plan for  states that Chennai will see a 3?C increase in temperature by 2100. Activists say  and global warming are not realities that are visible overnight. ""We need to have specific policies to phase out our dependence on fossil fuels,"" says Nandikesh Sivalingam, a Greenpeace campaigner for . ""The good news is that TN is already one of the leading states when it comes to renewable energy. Energy revolution is happening with solar power becoming cheaper than power from coal.""""We should be more sensible towards land use patterns, protecting our water and green spaces,"" says environmental activist Nityanand Jayaraman. A report titled ""Policy Framework and Preparedness for Implementing Measures to Effectively Deal with "" by Vasudha Foundation and Heinrich B?ll Foundation India found that urban development in TN is prone to vulnerabilities due to frequent impact of extreme events. The report analysed the resilience-level of TN, Karnataka, Goa and Andhra Pradesh to , based on the policy measures recommended by the International Panel on  and New Climate Economy report. The report, however, pointed out that TN is already a leader in wind energy generation and has ""a fairly robust afforestation and reforestation policy"". While the state might have policies on afforestation, implementation is the key. We need a stronger political will to arrest further environmental degradation.(The author is a campaigner with Greenpeace India)

Officials said that each forest division in the state has its own working plan which is valid for a period of 10 years. All development-related activities in a forest region are carried out on the basis of this plan.
DJK Sharma, additional principal chief conservator of forest in environment and  department, which comes under the Uttarakhand forest department, said, ¡°We understand the significance of forestry and its impact on food and water. Since these working plans are implemented for 10 years, we have decided to prepare them in accordance with SOPs mentioned in the state¡¯s action plan on . Also, it is important to formulate policies concerning reserve forests while keeping  in mind.¡±

Working plans for forest divisions are prepared in accordance with the national working plan code of the Union environment ministry. Officials said that at the state level, these plans are followed diligently and even a minor change requires the approval of the chief wildlife warden.

RN Jha, nodal officer in environment and  department, said, ¡°The department has already prepared a risk assessment chart of 95 blocks falling in the 13 districts of the state. The assessment has been done on the basis of 68 different indicators of . Each forest division would take into account these indicators before forming a working plan.¡±

Rashmi Bajaj, consultant with the United Nation Development Program (UNDP) on  in Uttarakhand, said, ¡°Even other state departments are being sensitized so that they frame policies with special focus on . As far as working plans are concerned, feedback from the communities residing in forest areas will be crucial in policy formation.¡±

Vijay Pinjarkar,India,"October 31, 2017",Nagpur,"Times of India, The (Mumbai, India) ","Nagpur: Faced with unseasonal hailstorms, wet and dry droughts, and damage to eco-systems, the state government has finally come out with a  policy. The comprehensive policy, announced two days ago, has directed all district collectors to prepare strong action plans considering geographical conditions of the district to make disaster management plans in line with  indicators. Protecting forests with participation of people, adopting crop pattern with changing situations, going solar for farming, setting up of climate proof villages, promoting organic farming, eco-system based schemes, and judicious use of water are some of the recommendations of the  policy announced by the government. As per the government, Nandurbar followed by Dhule, Buldhana, Jalgaon, Hingoli, Nashik, Jalna, Gondia, Washim and Gadchiroli districts are top on vulnerability index of  effects. The Centre had in 2008 directed all states to prepare an action plan. As reported by TOI in 2014, the 19-member Maharashtra State Council on  was formed in September 2008. Its chairperson was the chief minister, and it included ministers and experts. The council had awarded work on preparing state's action plan on  to The Energy Resources Institute (TERI), New Delhi, on August 20, 2009, for Rs98 lakh. Finally, after eight years, the state has announced adaptation and mitigation strategy based on the TERI plan. Based on the plan, the state has warned that owing to  there will be adverse impact on horticulture crops like pomegranate, grapes, oranges, bananas, mangoes etc by 2030. Besides, increasing temperatures and irregular rains will lead to spread of diseases. The government has defined a role for every department to tackle . Forest department has been told to increase ecological services, by even paying people to protect forests, and reduce biotic pressure on forests. It has been told to take up scientific management of forests. Similarly, water resources department (WRD) has been told to rejuvenate rivers, recycle waste water, and improve water management among a host of other directions. Other departments like agriculture, energy, health, public works, rural and urban development, finance and planning, and environment have been asked to devise eco-friendly strategies while implementing projects. As per the division-level index, by 2030 the minimum temperature in Nagpur will increase by 1.18-1.40 degrees, Amravati (1.44-1.64), Aurangabad (1.44-1.56), Nashik (1.4-1.68), Pune (1.15-1.28), and Konkan (1.1-1.28). Similar projections have been made for 2050 and 2070 also. To gear up to face the challenge, the state has recommended various steps for all departments by categorizing them in first and second priority. Forest department has been told to take up all recommendations on top priority.

The whole of Marathwada has been projected as the second most susceptible division in the state in terms of occurrence of natural crisis. Marathwada, which comprises eight districts, is likely to experience an increase in minimum temperature level up to 3.38 degrees Celsius in next four decades. The drought-prone region is expected to witness a 40% rise in average rainfall. The  adaptation policy, announced by the state environment department through government resolution issued on Thursday, has revealed shocking statistics related to gradual variation in weather condition. Accordingly, parts of North Maharashtra, also known as Khandesh, Marathwada and Vidarbha regions of the state, have been classified as having high vulnerability index. Stating that average temperature would rise in the state, the policy mentioned that the minimum temperature would rise further than the maximum temperature. Drop in agricultural productivity, increase in vector-borne diseases and loss of human lives and property due to extreme weather events are some of the fallouts associated with . The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI) and UK Met Office were supplied with additional weather-related statistics to project consequences of the  in different parts of Maharashtra as part of state mitigation policy on the issue. While the Centre had asked all states to prepare an action plan on , we are now ready with the necessary roadmap, government authorities said. The state cabinet recently gave its approval to the  adaptation policy, which spelt out department-wise action plan to deal with possible consequences. It proposes protection of rivers and their sources, setting up of environment-friendly villages, plantation of weather resistant crops and fruit varieties and use of non-conventional energy as some of the broad intervention measures to tackle . The departments of forests, water resources, health agriculture, rural development, urban development and environment have been given specific measures for mitigating the approaching natural crisis. Shriniwas Aundhkar, director of Nanded-based MGMs Centre for Astronomy, said the statistics mentioned in the state  adaptation policy needs to be validated against related studies of the Intergovernmental Panel on . The state policy too needs to be studied thoroughly in the light of national and international studies. Nevertheless, it is good that Maharashtra has shown due concern towards the issue and is ready with an action plan, he said.

There, she was the only youth who got the opportunity to interview UN secretary-general Ban Ki-moon. The Paris agreement, which was adopted in December 2015, sought to accelerate and intensify the actions and investment needed for a sustainable low carbon future. The Bonn conference focuses on strategies to reach these ambitious goals, appropriate financial flows; an enhanced capacity building framework before 2025, which includes an initiative for capacity building, Yugratna told TOI from Germany. Yugratna became the youngest person to address as many as 100 world leaders at the 2009 United Nation summit on  in New York. At COP21, she represented youth on global warming at a ceremony where 150 countries signed the Paris Agreement on . It was in 1992 when many countries joined an international treaty - the United Nations Framework Convention on  - as a framework for international cooperation to combat  by limiting average global temperature increase, and coping with impacts that were, by then, inevitable. By 1995, countries launched negotiations to strengthen the global response to  and two years later, adopted the Kyoto Protocol. The Kyoto Protocol legally binds developed country (Parties to the treaty) to emission reduction targets. There are now 197 parties to the convention and 192 parties to the Kyoto Protocol. The aim of the Paris agreement is to strengthen the global response to the threat of  by keeping the global temperature rise this century well below 2 degrees celsius above pre-industrial levels. The agreement also aims to strengthen the ability of countries to deal with the impacts of . The Bonn conference, therefore, is to take the decisions forward, Yugratna said.

But now, the average radius of cyclones in recent years like Hudhud, Phailin, Aila and Thane has increased to 240km.Hence, the risk area along the coast has gone up to 480km.This means twice the number of people require to be evacua ted in case of a cyclone warning,"" Bhaskaran explained. He also pointed out  had increased oceanwave activity . ""In southern oceans, synoptic or cyclonic scale activity has increased in the past decade. These activities can generate long waves that can reach the Bengal and Odisha coast as well as Bangladesh. These long waves can modify local waves generated by wind and affect the pattern of erosion. Sunderbans is already experiencing the effect of long waves. In the Head Bay region bordering India and Bangladesh, the wave activity is increasing on the eastern side while it is decreasing on the western side. This is altering sedimentary dymanics and causing changes in the shore line. All these aspects will be researched at the centre,"" said Bhaskaran. The aim of various research activities undertaken by the centre of excellence will be to predict various  scenarios as well as mitigation and adaptation possibilities in Bengal and Odisha.
